        "\n",
        "This module uses the [Penn World\n",
        "Tables](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en) which measure\n",
        "income, input, output, and productivity, covering 183 countries between\n",
        "1950 and 2019. Before beginning this module, download this data in the\n",

        "\n",
        "## 15.1 What is Panel Data?\n",
        "\n",
        "In economics, we typically have data consisting of many units observed\n",
        "at a particular point in time. This is called cross-sectional data.\n",
        "There may be several different versions of the data set that are\n",
        "collected over time (monthly, annually, etc.), but each version includes\n",
        "an entirely different set of individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let’s consider a Canadian cross-sectional data set:\n",
        "*General Social Survey Cycle 31: Family, 2017*. In this data set, the\n",
        "first observation is a 55 year old married woman who lives in Alberta\n",
        "with two children. When the *General Social Survey Cycle 25: Family,\n",
        "2011* was collected six years earlier, there were probably similar women\n",
        "surveyed, but it is extremely unlikely that this exact same woman was\n",
        "included in that data set as well. Even if she was included, we would\n",
        "have no way to match her data over the two years of the survey.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-sectional data allows us to explore variation between individuals\n",
        "at one point in time but does not allow us to explore variation over\n",
        "time for those same individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time-series data sets contain observations over several years for only\n",
        "one unit, such as country, state, province, etc. For example, measures\n",
        "of income, output, unemployment, and fertility for Canada from 1960 to\n",
        "2020 would be considered time-series data. Time-series data allows us to\n",
        "explore variation over time for one individual unit (e.g. Canada), but\n",
        "does not allow us to explore variation between individual units\n",
        "(i.e. multiple countries) at any one point in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Panel data allows us to observe the same unit across multiple time\n",
        "periods. For example, the [Penn World\n",
        "Tables](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en) is a panel\n",
        "data set that measures income, output, input, and productivity, covering\n",
        "183 countries from 1950 to the near present. There are also microdata\n",

        "the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY),\n",
        "which followed the same children from 1994 to 2010, surveying them every\n",
        "two years as they progressed from childhood to adulthood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Panel data sets allow us to answer questions that we cannot answer with\n",
        "time-series and cross-sectional data. They allow us to simultaneously\n",
        "explore variation over time for individual countries (for example) and\n",
        "variation between individuals at one point in time. This approach is\n",
        "extremely productive for two reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Panel data sets are large, much larger than if we were to use data\n",
        "    collected at one point in time.\n",
        "2.  Panel data regressions control for variables that do not change over\n",
        "    time and are difficult to measure, such as geography and culture.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this sense, panel data sets allow us to answer empirical questions\n",
        "that cannot be answered with other types of data such as cross-sectional\n",
        "or time-series data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we move forward exploring panel data sets in this module, we\n",
        "should understand the two main types of panel data:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A **Balanced Panel** is a panel data set in which we observe *all*\n",
        "    units over *all* included time periods. Suppose we have a data set\n",
        "    following the school outcomes of a select group of $N$ children over\n",
        "    $T$ years. This is common in studies which investigate the effects\n",
        "    of early childhood interventions on relevant outcomes over time. If\n",
        "    the panel data set is balanced, we will see $T$ observations for\n",
        "    each child corresponding to the $T$ years they have been tracked. As\n",
        "    a result, our data set in total will have $n = N*T$ observations.\n",
        "-   An **Unbalanced Panel** is a panel data set in which we do *not*\n",
        "    observe all units over all included time periods. Suppose in our\n",
        "    data set tracking select children’s education outcomes over time,\n",
        "    and that some children drop out of the study. This panel data set\n",
        "    would be an unbalanced panel because it would necessarily have\n",
        "    $n < N*T$ observations, since the children who dropped out would not\n",
        "    have observations for the years they were no longer in the study.\n",
        "\n",
        "We learned the techniques to create a balanced panel in [Module\n",
        "7](https://comet.arts.ubc.ca/docs/Research/econ490-stata/07_Within_Group.html).\n",
        "Essentially, all that is needed is to create a new data set that\n",
        "includes only the years for which there are no missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 15.2 Preparing Our Data for Panel Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step in any panel data analysis is to identify which variable\n",
        "is the panel variable and which variable is the time variable. The panel\n",
        "variable is the identifier of the units that are observed over time. The\n",
        "second step is indicating that information to Stata.\n",
        "\n",
        "We are going to use the Penn World Data (discussed above) in this\n",
        "example. In that data set, the panel variable is either *country* or\n",
        "*countrycode*, and the time variable is *year*.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "clear*\n",
        "*cd \"\"\n",
        "use pwt100.dta, clear\n",
        "describe country countrycode year\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "When the decribe command executed, did you see that the variable *year*\n",
        "is an integer (i.e. a number like 2020) and that *country* or\n",
        "*countrycode* are string variables (i.e. they are words like “Canada”)?\n",
        "Specifying the panel and time variables requires that both of the\n",
        "variables we are using are coded as numeric variables, and so our first\n",
        "step is to create a new numeric variable that represents the country\n",
        "variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, we can use the `encode` command that we saw in [Module\n",
        "6](https://comet.arts.ubc.ca/docs/Research/econ490-stata/06_Creating_Variables.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "encode countrycode, gen(ccode) \n",
        "\n",
        "label var ccode \"Numeric code that represents the country\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "We can see in our data editor that this command created a unique code\n",
        "for each country and saved it in a variable that we have named *ccode*.\n",
        "For example, in the data editor we can see that Canada was given the\n",
        "code 31 and Brazil was given the code 25.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we are able to proceed with specifying both our panel and time\n",
        "variables by using the command `xtset`. With this command, we first list\n",
        "the panel variable and then the time variable, followed by the interval\n",
        "of observation.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "We can tell that we have done this correctly when the output indicates\n",
        "that the “Time variable” is “year”.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within our panel data set, our use of this command above states that we\n",
        "observe countries (indicated by country codes) over many time periods\n",
        "that are separated into year groupings (delta = 1 year, meaning that\n",
        "each country has an observation for each year, specified by the *yearly*\n",
        "option). The option for periodicity of the observations is helpful. For\n",
        "instance, if we wanted each country to have an observation for every two\n",
        "years instead of every year, we would specify delta(2) as our\n",
        "periodicity option to `xtset`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Always make sure to check the output of `xtset` carefully to see that\n",
        "the time variable and panel variable have been properly specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 15.3 Basic Regressions with Panel Data\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, we are going to focus on the skills we need to run our own\n",
        "panel data regressions. In section 15.6, there are more details about\n",
        "the econometrics of panel data regressions that may help with the\n",
        "understanding of these approaches. Please make sure you understand that\n",
        "theory before beginning your own research.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have specified the panel and time variables we are working\n",
        "with, we can begin to run regressions using our panel data. For panel\n",
        "data regressions we simply replace `regress` witht the command `xtreg`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s try this out by regressing the natural log of GDP per capita on\n",
        "the natural log of human capital. We have included the `describe` to\n",
        "help us understand the variables we are using in this exercise.\n",

        "\n",
        "xtreg lngdp lnhc\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The coefficients in a panel regression are interpreted similarly to\n",
        "those in a basic OLS regression. Because we have taken the natural log\n",
        "of our variables, we can interpret the coefficient on each explanatory\n",
        "variable as being a $\\beta$ % increase in the dependent variable\n",
        "associated with a 1% increase in the explanatory variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, in the regression results above, a 1% increase in human capital\n",
        "leads to a roughly 2% increase in real GDP per capita. That’s a huge\n",
        "effect, but then again this model is almost certainly misspecified due\n",
        "to omitted variable bias. Namely, we are likely missing a number of\n",
        "explanatory variables that explain variation in both GDP per capita and\n",
        "human capital, such as savings and population growth rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "One thing we know is that GDP per capita can be impacted by the\n",
        "individual characteristics of a country that do not change much over\n",
        "time. For example, it is known that distance from the equator has an\n",
        "impact on the standard of living of a country; countries that are closer\n",
        "to the equator are generally poorer than those farther from it. This is\n",
        "a time-invariant characteristic that we might want to control for in our\n",
        "regression. Similarly, we know that GDP per capita could be similarly\n",
        "impacted in many countries by a shock at one point in time. For example,\n",
        "a worldwide global recession would affect the GDP per capita of all\n",
        "countries at a given time such that values of GDP per capita in this\n",
        "time period are uniformly different in all countries from values in\n",
        "other periods. That seems like a time-variant characteristic (time\n",
        "trend) that we might want to control for in our regression. Fortunately,\n",
        "with panel data regressions, we can account for these sources of\n",
        "endogeneity. Let’s look at how panel data helps us do this.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15.3.1 Fixed-Effects Models\n",
        "\n",
        "We refer to shocks that are invariant based on some variable\n",
        "(e.g. household level shocks that don’t vary with year or time-specific\n",
        "shocks that don’t vary with household) as **fixed-effects**. For\n",
        "instance, we can define household fixed-effects, time fixed-effects, and\n",
        "so on. Notice that this is an assumption on the error terms, and as\n",
        "such, when we include fixed-effects to our specification they become\n",
        "part of the model we assume to be true.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we ran our regression of log real GDP per capita on log human\n",
        "capital from earlier, we were concerned about omitted variable bias and\n",
        "endogeneity. Specifically, we were concerned about distance from the\n",
        "equator positively impacting both human capital and real GDP per capita,\n",
        "in which case our measure of human capital would be correlated with our\n",
        "error term, preventing us from interpreting our regression result as\n",
        "causal. We are now able to add country fixed-effects to our regression\n",
        "to account for this and come closer to determining the pure effect of\n",
        "human capital on GDP growth. There are two ways to do this. Let’s look\n",
        "at the more obvious one first.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Approach 1**: create a series of country dummy variables and include\n",
        "them in the regression. For example, we would have one dummy variable\n",
        "called “Canada” that would be equal to 1 if the country is Canada and 0\n",
        "if not. We would have dummy variables for all but one of the countries\n",
        "in this data set to avoid perfect collinearity. Rather than defining all\n",
        "of these dummies manually and including them in our `regress` command,\n",
        "we can simply add `i.varname` into our regression. Stata will then\n",
        "manually create all of the country dummy variables for us.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "xtreg lngdp lnhc i.ccode\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with this approach is that we end up with a huge table\n",
        "containing the coefficients of every country dummy, none of which we\n",
        "care about. We are interested in the relationship between GDP and human\n",
        "capital, not the mean values of GDP for each country relative to the\n",
        "omitted one. Luckily for us, a well-known result is that controlling for\n",
        "fixed-effects is equivalent to adding multiple dummy variables. This\n",
        "leads us into the second approach to including fixed-effects in a\n",
        "regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Approach 2**: We can alternatively apply fixed-effects to the\n",
        "regression by adding `fe` as an option on the regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "xtreg lngdp lnhc, fe\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "We obtained the same coefficient and standard errors on our `lnhc`\n",
        "explanatory variable using both approaches!\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15.3.2 Random-Effects Models\n",
        "\n",
        "One type of model we can also run is a **random-effects model**. The\n",
        "main difference between a random and fixed-effects model is that, with\n",
        "the random-effects model, differences across countries are assumed to be\n",
        "random. This allows us to treat time-invariant variables such as\n",
        "latitude as control variables. To run a random-effects model, just add\n",
        "`re` as an option in `xtreg` like below.\n",
        "\n",

        "difference in results between all of these models.\n",
        "\n",
        "This, however, will not always be the case. The test to determine if you\n",
        "should use the fixed-effects model (`fe`) or the random-effects model\n",
        "(`re`) is called the Hausman test.\n",
        "\n",
        "To run this test in Stata, start by running a fixed-effects model and\n",
        "ask Stata to store the estimation results under then name “fixed”:\n",
