        "\n",
        "### 6.2.2 Dummy Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Dummy variables are variables that can only take on two values: 0 and 1.\n",
        "It is useful to think of a dummy variable as the answer to a “yes” or\n",
        "“no” question. With a dummy variable, the answer yes is coded as “1” and\n",
        "no is coded as “0”.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of question that are used to create dummy variables include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Is the person female? Females are coded “1” and everyone else is\n",
        "    coded “0”.\n",
        "2.  Does the person have a university degree? People with a degree are\n",
        "    coded “1” and everyone else is coded “0”.\n",
        "3.  Is the person married? Married people are coded “1” and everyone\n",
        "    else is coded “0”.\n",
        "4.  Is the person a millennial? People born between 1980 and 1996 are\n",
        "    coded “1” and those born in other years are coded “0”.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you have probably already figured out, dummy variables are used\n",
        "primarily for data that is qualitative and cannot be ranked in any way.\n",
        "For example, being married is qualitative and “married” is neither\n",
        "higher nor lower than “single”. But they are sometimes also used for\n",
        "variables that are qualitative and ranked, such as level of education.\n",
        "Further, dummy variables are sometimes used for variables that are\n",
        "quantitative, such as age groupings.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to remember that dummy variables must always be used\n",
        "when we want to include categorical (qualitative) variables in our\n",
        "analysis. These are variables such as sex, gender, race, marital status,\n",
        "religiosity, immigration status etc. We can’t use these variables\n",
        "without creating a dummy variable because the results found would in no\n",
        "way be meaningful, as we are working with variables which have been\n",
        "numerically scaled in an arbitrary way. This is especially true for\n",
        "interpreting the coefficients outputted from regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6.2.3 Creating dummy variables using `generate`\n",
        "\n",
        "As an example, let’s create a dummy variable which indicates if the\n",
        "observation is identified as female. To do this, we are going to use the\n",
        "command `generate` which generates a completely new variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "generate female = 1 if sex == \"F\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "What Stata does here is that it defines our dummy variable as 1 whenever\n",
        "the condition `sex == \"F\"` holds. However, we didn’t tell Stata what to\n",
        "do if the condition `sex == \"M\"` does not hold! Let’s do that below.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "generate female = 0 if sex == \"M\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Whoops! We got an error. This says that our variable is already defined.\n",
        "Stata does this because it doesn’t want us to accidentally overwrite an\n",
        "existing variable. Whenever we want to replace an existing variable, we\n",
        "have to use the command `replace`.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "replace female = 0 if sex == \"M\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "There is another, simpler way to create a dummy variable, which is shown\n",
        "below.\n",

        "``` {stata}\n",

        "replace female = ( sex == \"F\") \n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "What Stata does here is that it defines our dummy variable as 1 whenever\n",
        "the condition `sex == \"F\"` holds. Otherwise, it directly makes the\n",
        "variable take the value of zero. Depending on what we’re doing, we may\n",
        "want it to be the case that our dummy takes on the value of 0 when *sex*\n",
        "is missing. We could do that as we did above, using the `replace`\n",
        "command.\n",
        "\n",
        "We could have also used the command `capture drop female` before we used\n",
        "`generate`. The `capture` command tells Stata to ignore any error in the\n",
        "command that immediately follows. In this example, this would do the\n",
        "following:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   If the variable that is being dropped (here, *female*) didn’t exist,\n",
        "    the `drop female` command would automatically create an error. The\n",
        "    `capture` command tells Stata to ignore that problem.\n",
        "-   If the variable (*female*) did exist already, the `drop female`\n",
        "    command would work just fine, so that line will proceed as normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6.2.4 Creating Multiple Dummy Variables using `tabulate`\n",
        "\n",
        "We already talked about how to create dummy variables with `generate`\n",
        "and `replace`. Let’s see how this can be done for a whole set of dummy\n",
        "variables. For our example, we will create one dummy for each region\n",

        "five new variables are called *reg1*, *reg2*, *reg3*, *reg4*, and\n",
        "*reg5*. We can run the command `describe` alongside each of these\n",
        "variables, or we can simply run `describe reg*`, which provides\n",
        "information for all variables starting with “reg”. Stata has helpfully\n",
        "labeled these variables with data labels from the region variable.\n",
        "Sometimes, we might want to change the names for our own project to\n",

        "Sometimes we want to generate variables after some transformations\n",
        "(e.g. squaring, taking logs, combining different variables). We can do\n",
        "that by simply writing the expression for the desired transformation.\n",
