        "A possible issue with this model comes from omitted variable bias: it is\n",
        "possible that the decision to attend school is influenced by other\n",
        "individual characteristics that are also correlated with earnings. For\n",
        "example, think of individuals with high innate ability. They may want to\n",
        "enroll in school for longer and obtain higher-level degrees. Moreover,\n",
