        "\n",
        "In this repository, there is a folder named “data”, with a sub-folder\n",
        "named “raw”. In that sub-folder, there are two different versions of the\n",
        "same data set: “fake_data.csv” and “fake_data.dta”. The data sets\n",
        "simulate information from workers in the years 1982-2012 in a fake\n",
        "country where, in 2003, a policy was enacted that allowed some workers\n",
        "to enter a training program with the purpose of boosting their earnings.\n",
        "We will be using this data set to learn how to explore and manipulate\n",

        "## 5.1 Clearing the Workspace\n",
        "\n",
        "Do-files should begin with a command that clears the previous work that\n",
        "has been open in Stata. This makes sure that:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  We do not waste computer memory on things other than the current\n",
        "    project.\n",
        "2.  Whatever result we obtain in the current session truly belongs to\n",
        "    that session.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can clear the workspace of many different things (see `help clear` if\n",
        "needed). For the purpose of this lecture, the most comprehensive thing\n",
        "to do is to run the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "clear *\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "## 5.2 Changing Directories\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we get started on importing data into Stata, it is useful to know\n",
        "how to change the folder that Stata accesses whenever we run a command\n",
        "that either opens or saves a file. Once we instruct Stata to change the\n",
        "directory to a specific folder, from that point onward it will open\n",
        "files from that folder and save all files to that folder, including data\n",
        "files, do-files, and log-files. Stata will continue to do this until\n",
        "either the program is closed or we change to another directory. This\n",
        "means that every time we open Stata, we need to change the directory to\n",
        "the one we want to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having a main directory with sub-directories is extremely important for\n",
        "research. When we are doing large research projects that use many\n",
        "different data sets from different sources as well as do-files and\n",
        "log-files that perform different tasks, it can be easy to lose track of\n",
        "what is where. For that reason, we will want to create different folders\n",
        "for many of our different steps. We will go into more detail about this\n",
        "in [Module\n",
        "18](https://comet.arts.ubc.ca/docs/Research/econ490-stata/18_Wf_Guide2.html),\n",
        "but it is a good idea to get into the habit of doing this as soon as you\n",
        "start a project.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will begin by using the `pwd` command to view the current working\n",
        "directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "pwd\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** We write the directory path within quotation marks to make\n",
        "sure Stata interprets this as a single string of words. If we don’t do\n",
        "this, we may encounter issues with folders that include blank spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let’s change the directory to the specific location where we saved\n",
        "the fake_data file using the command below. We can change our workspace\n",
        "to a directory named “some_folder/some_sub_folder” by writing\n",
        "`cd \"some_folder/some_sub_folder\"`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the space below to do this on your own computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "cd \" \" \n",
        "* type your file path to the folder containing the data between the quotation marks in the line above\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that once we change directories, Stata outputs the full name of\n",
        "the directory where we are currently working.\n",
        "\n",
        "One trick to using `cd` is that we can use periods (.) to move back\n",
        "folders: two period to move back one folder, three periods to move back\n",
        "two folders, etc. Try the command below to compare the folder Stata is\n",
        "now directed to with the command above. You can repeat this using two\n",
        "periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "cd ..\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "An easier way to change the directory is by typing the `cd` command\n",
        "followed by the folder you want to set as your working directory. In\n",
        "this method, quotation marks are not necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` {stata}\n",
        "cd myfolder\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use myfolder as a placeholder for the folder you want to set as your working directory\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, we can use the command `cd` on its own to go back to the\n",

        "\n",
        "The process for changing directories in Stata varies depending on the\n",
        "type of computer being used. If one approach does not work, it is\n",
        "possible that the method is not suitable to your computer. Please see\n",

        "\n",
        "### 5.3.1 Excel and CSV Files\n",
        "\n",
        "When looking for the data for your research, you will realize that many\n",
        "data sets are not formatted for Stata (.dta files). In some cases, data\n",
        "sets are formatted as Excel or CSV files. Not surprisingly, the command\n",
        "to load in data is called `import`. It comes in two main forms:\n",
        "`import excel` and `import delimited`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s import the data set called `fake_data.csv`. We need to use\n",
        "`import delimited` to import this data into Stata. The syntax for this\n",
        "command is\n",
        "`import delimited [using] filename [, import_delimited_options]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We always include the option `clear` when we use import to make sure\n",
        "we’re clearing any previous data set that was opened before in our Stata\n",
        "session. Recall that to use an option, we include a comma (`,`) after\n",
        "the command line and write the option name. Feel free to read the\n",
        "documentation of these commands by writing `help import delimited`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the command below will not import the data unless you have\n",
        "changed your directory (above) to the folder which contains this file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ignore the following block of code that will create a csv file to be\n",
        "used as an example**\n",
        "\n",

        "sets that are not in Stata format, it is very important to check whether\n",
        "the first row of the data includes the variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the command `list` to look at our data. It is better to limit\n",
        "the observations we see since we don’t want to see all 3 million! Thus,\n",
        "we use `in` to constrain the list to the first 3 observations below.\n",

        "of the data set, which in this case is correct. If that’s not the case,\n",
        "we need to include the import delimited option `varnames(#|nonames)`,\n",
        "where we replace `#` by the observation number that includes the\n",
        "variable names. If the data has no names, the option is\n",

        "### 5.3.2 Stata Files\n",
        "\n",
        "To open data sets in the Stata format, we use the command `use`. As we\n",

        "\n",
        "It is also possible to download data sets directly from other sources,\n",

        ".csv or Excel file.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, it is possible to import data from the World Bank using the\n",

        "### 5.3.4 Other Files\n",
        "\n",
        "We can open a number of different data files in Stata with no issues. If\n",
        "you are struggling, one option at UBC is to use the program StatTransfer\n",

        "\n",
        "In addition to the `describe` command, in the Stata interface we can\n",
        "also open the data editor and see the raw data as if it were an Excel\n",
        "file. To do this, we type `browse`. This command will open a new Stata\n",
        "window. If we want to do this from within Jupyter, we use the command\n",
