        "\n",
        "For example, if we type `help rename`, we can see that `rename` can be\n",

        "\n",
        "Much like any other programming language, there are `for` and `while`\n",

        "names).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is very common that these loops create a *local* scope (i.e. the\n",
        "iteration labels only exist within a loop). A `local` in Stata is a\n",
        "special variable that we create ourselves that temporarily stores\n",
        "information. We’ll discuss locals in the next module, but consider this\n",
        "simple example in which the letter “i” is used as a place holder for the\n",
