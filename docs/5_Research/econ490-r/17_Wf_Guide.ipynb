        "RStudio Projects are built-in features of RStudio that allow us to\n",
        "create a working directory for a project which we can launch whenever we\n",
        "want. In this way, the project allows us to refer to all of our files\n",
        "using relative and not absolute paths. This approach also prevents us\n",
        "from needing to set our directory every time we work on our project. In\n",
        "this sense, it is quite a valuable tool both from a collaboration and\n",
        "efficiency standpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create an RStudio Project, first launch RStudio. Then navigate\n",
        "through **File**, **New Project**, **New Directory**, and then **New\n",
        "Project**. We can then choose the name of our project and select where\n",
        "we would like the project to be stored. To allow for the project to live\n",
        "on OneDrive (which is highly recommended), we select the OneDrive\n",
        "directory in our computer. Finally, we can create the project. If we\n",
        "access your OneDrive folder on our computer, we should then see a\n",
        "subfolder with our project name and a default .RProj object already\n",
        "inside, which looks like the one below.\n",

        "click the .RStudio Project object above. We can also start a fresh\n",
        "session in RStudio and navigate to our project by selecting **File**,\n",
        "**Open Project**, and then following the specified instructions.\n",

        "\n",
        "Now that we have an RStudio Project directory in our computer, we can\n",
        "organize folders within this larger folder. This is important given\n",

        "numerous files for our project, such as raw data files, scripts, tables,\n",

        "these files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the main folder, we’ll want to sort all of our files into\n",

        "\n",
        "Each sub-folder consists of a specific category of files and is numbered\n",
        "to indicate the workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **data:** contains all the data files;\n",
        "-   **scripts:** contains all the R scripts used to process, clean and\n",
        "    analyze the data files;\n",
        "-   **tables:** contains all the regression tables, summary statistics,\n",
        "    etc.;\n",
        "-   **figures:** contains all the graphs and figures;\n",
        "-   **literature:** contains papers and documents related to your\n",
        "    literature review;\n",
        "-   **paper:** contains word documents or LaTeX files relating to the\n",
        "    written part of your paper;\n",
        "-   **slides:** contains presentation slides.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** We’ll want to avoid spaces, special characters, or capital\n",
        "letters in our folder or file names. If we need to use spaces, we can\n",
        "use underscores `_` . We will also want to number our files to indicate\n",
        "our workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17.2.4 Scripts Folder\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s almost never a good idea to use one script for an entire project.\n",
        "Instead, we will want to create different scripts for different tasks\n",
        "and add descriptive labels to reflect our workflow. As mentioned in the\n",
        "previous section, we should prefix our files with numbers to align with\n",
        "the workflow sequence.\n",

        "data and generates core variables that will be used in subsequent\n",
        "scripts. The second script, `descriptive_statistics.R`, generates\n",
        "descriptive statistics and relevant figures. The third script,\n",
        "`results.R`, runs the final regressions and generates regression tables.\n",
        "The master script, `master_script.R`, runs all these other scripts. We\n",
        "will discuss its role in detail in a moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Some researchers prefer to use different scripts for different\n",
        "figures and tables, which is completely fine as long as the files are\n",
        "labeled well. If we want to generate different tables and figures within\n",
        "the same script, we should be sure to write them into separate code\n",
        "blocks within a script so that they can be easily distinguished.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17.2.5 Choosing Good File Names\n",
        "\n",
        "While you are welcome to use your own naming conventions, it can be\n",
        "helpful to prefix your file names with numbers to align with your\n",
        "workflow, post-fixed with version numbers. Version numbers could be\n",
        "`_v1`, `_v2` (i.e. “ECON490_script_v12.R”) or they could be indicated by\n",
        "dates (i.e. “Thesis_script_230430.R”).\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>Note:</b> Following the yymmdd (year month date) format when using\n",
        "dates will automatically sort our files with the latest version at the\n",
        "top. Other date formats will not sort the files in the correct order and\n",
        "thus defeat the purpose of adding a post-fixed version number.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we make progress with our project, we might find ourselves collecting\n",
        "many versions of the same files. As older versions become redundant, it\n",
        "is best to delete them or move them to a temp folder. Creating a temp\n",
        "folder for old scripts, tables, or documents can be helpful in keeping\n",
        "our main folders neat, especially if we are hesitant to delete them or\n",
        "if we are susceptible to digital hoarding (as many of us are).\n",

        "\n",
        "One advantage of using projects in RStudio is that our working directory\n",
