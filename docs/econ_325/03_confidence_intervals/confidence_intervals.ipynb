        "So, how can we apply this knowledge to real empirical work? While\n",

        "answer to this question, this current notebook provides a starting\n",
        "point. In this notebook, we will learn about a key concept which relates\n",
        "to how we report our results empirically when sampling from a\n",

        "\n",
        "A **confidence interval** is an estimate that gives us a range of values\n",
        "within which we expect a population parameter to fall. Put another way,\n",
        "it provides a range within which we can have a certain degree of\n",
        "*confidence* that a desired parameter, such as a population mean, lies.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is in contrast to a **point estimate**. A point estimate is a\n",

        "For instance, the sample mean and sample standard deviation are point\n",
        "estimates of the population mean and the population standard deviation\n",
        "(respectively).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s make this concrete with an example.\n",

        "## Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose that we want to know the mean GPA of undergraduate students at\n",
        "universities across Canada. Finding this exact mean (the population\n",
        "mean) would require us to collect the GPA of every single undergraduate\n",

        "result, and as we have already seen, we collect a sample of students and\n",
        "find the mean of their GPAs (the sample mean). This allows us to make\n",
        "inferences about the desired, yet unobtainable, population mean. The\n",
        "sample mean we find is called our point estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, as we already learned, this sample mean will be different every\n",
        "time we draw a different random sample of undergraduate students.\n",
        "Suppose one random sample we draw just so happens to include many\n",
        "high-achieving students, while another does not. The first sample will\n",

        "second sample will give us a point estimate much lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "So our question becomes: how can we report an estimate for the\n",
        "population mean GPA if we draw a different mean GPA for every possible\n",
