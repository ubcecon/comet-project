        "It’s important to begin with the fundamental problem of statistical\n",
        "inference. Let’s start with a **population**, which is commonly defined\n",
        "as the complete collection of all individuals or entities we are\n",
        "studying. From here, we want to determine a particular characteristic of\n",
        "the population, the **population parameter**. For example, if we want to\n",
        "determine the average height of a Canadian resident, our population\n",
        "would be every Canadian resident and our population parameter would be\n",
        "average height. Imagine how easy life would be for economists if we had\n",
        "access to any population parameter we desired. If we had perfect data\n",
        "from our population, we would be able to determine the average returns\n",
        "to education, the impact of stimulus checks for every resident, and so\n",
        "much more with absolute certainty all by surveying every member of the\n",
        "population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately collecting data from the entire population is often too\n",
        "expensive and impractical. A more realistic way to find what we’re\n",
        "looking is to survey a **sample**, a subset of individuals or entities\n",
        "from the population. Through this sample, we can gather a **sample\n",
        "estimate**, an estimate of the population parameter from our sample.\n",
        "From our example, it would be much more practical to survey a 1000\n",
        "people in Canada and calculate their average height. Evidently, this\n",
        "won’t exactly the match the true average height of a Canadian resident,\n",
        "because we haven’t based our calculation off every Canadian resident,\n",
        "but it’s probably a good estimate. But how do we know we picked a\n",

        "## Simple Random Samples\n",
        "\n",

        "estimators** of the population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two statistical approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  We could conduct a census. To do this, we would need to measure the\n",
        "    height of all 38 million people living in Canada. This technique\n",
        "    produces little error, but comes at a very high cost. Moreover, we\n",
        "    may not actually be able to collect all of this data - what if we\n",
        "    miss someone?\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  We could take a **simple random sample** of the Canadian population,\n",
        "    in which all 38 million Canadians have an equal probability of being\n",
