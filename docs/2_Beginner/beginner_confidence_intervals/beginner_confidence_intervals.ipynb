        "confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Misconception 1:\n",
        "\n",
        "*If we have a 95% confidence interval, this is a **concrete range**\n",
        "under which our estimated population parameter **must** fall*.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we repeated our sampling procedure many times and constructed a\n",
        "confidence interval each time, we would expect about 95% of these\n",
        "confidence intervals to contain our true parameter. **Note that this\n",
        "does not imply that the confidence interval we calculated contains the\n",
        "true parameter**. Since about 5% of our confidence intervals will not\n",
        "contain the true parameter, nothing prevents the confidence interval we\n",
        "calculate from being one of those 5% that don’t contain the parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Main takeaway is that the confidence interval is an *estimator* and not\n",
        "an official range of possible values for the population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Misconception 2:\n",
        "\n",
        "*If we have a confidence level of 95%, 95% of our population data must\n",
        "lie within the calculated confidence interval*.\n",

        "the range within which 95% of our data lie, we must consult a histogram\n",
        "for the population and calculate percentiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if our data is quite bimodaly distributed (around half of\n",

        "clustered far to the right of our mean), our calculated 95% confidence\n",

        "of calculated intervals we expect to contain the true parameter of\n",
        "interest if we calculated these intervals over and over. This means any\n",
        "one interval from a sample of $n = 100$ has a 95% chance of containing\n",
