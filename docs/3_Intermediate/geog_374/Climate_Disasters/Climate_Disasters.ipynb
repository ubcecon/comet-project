    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This module uses a data set on disasters to illustrate working with date variables. The data comes from Climate Central's exploration of climate events from 1980-present, including the time interval between major events. The Hewitt Lab would like to acknowledge the help of Dr. Dan Moore, who provided some of the code for this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disaster fatigue** is a term used to describe the phenomenon of exhaustion and apathy that can arise among individuals and communities as a result of repeated exposure to disasters or crises. It refers to the sense of feeling overwhelmed and emotionally depleted by the incessant flow of news and information regarding disasters, as well as the long-term economic impacts that such disasters can have on the resiliency of local communities. In this module, we will be looking at disasters associated with climate change. As More et al. (2018) discuss, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission are triggering many new climate hazards around the globe. Unless we substantially reduce these, the results could be catastrophic.\n",

    "\n",
    "Over time, disaster fatigue can lead to a reduced ability to respond, recover and prepare, as the resources of communities are depleted. People may also become desensitized to the the impacts of each new disaster, particularly at national and international levels where such disasters are not felt equally across the population or by policy makers. This can make it more challenging to prepare for disasters, which may ultimately worsen their impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disaster fatigue can also be exacerbated by other factors. Individuals may have a lack of trust in authorities or institutions, feelings of helplessness or hopelessness, and ongoing stress and trauma resulting from previous disasters or other life events. Meanwhile, communities may be overwhelmed financially or impacted negatively by rigid response policies that are not flexible enough to meet the emergent needs of a natural disaster as it unfolds."

Specifically, the LOESS algorithm assigns weights to nearby data points according to their distance from the point being smoothed, and these weights are then used to fit a weighted least squares regression line through the data points in that neighbourhood.
