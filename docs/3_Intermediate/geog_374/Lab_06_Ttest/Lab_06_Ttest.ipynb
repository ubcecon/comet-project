    "When many of us think of Charles Darwin, we think of his voyages to the Galapagos Islands and *The Origin of Species* which describes his theory of evolution and natural selection. However, few realize that after he returned from his voyage aboard the HMS Beagle, he would never leave Britain again due to ailing health. Rather, the gardens at Darwin House in the Kentish countryside would become a laboratory for him. He would grow all sorts of exotic specimens that were sent to him by botanists from around the world.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will conduct a t-test to analyze an experiment conducted by Charles Darwin in which he sought to determine if there was a difference between the growth of cross-pollinated plants and self-fertilized plants. In cross-pollinated plants, the pollen and ovule are from different individuals, whereas in self-fertilized plants, the pollen and ovule are from the same individual. He postulated that cross-pollinated plants would produce fitter offspring when compared to self-fertilized plants. In order to test this, Darwin raised pairs of plants (one self-fertilized and one cross-pollinated) in the same pot, and then measured differences in their heights."

    "### Two Sample T-tests\n",
    "\n",
    "A two sample t-test is a form of hypothesis test that is used to determine if two groups are significantly different from each other by comparing the means of those groups. However, there are some basic assumptions that must be fulfilled before using this hypothesis test:\n",
    "* The populations from which the sample groups are taken are assumed to be normal.\n",
    "* Samples are randomly selected and independent.\n",
    "* The samples are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances). If this is not the case, we can conduct a t-test for unequal variances (Welch's t-test). \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Example:** An education researcher would like to compare the knowledge gains from students' environmental education in two different grade 6 classes that use different approaches to teaching. One class takes students on a field trip to a local park, while the second class goes on a virtual field trip of the same park. The dependent variable is the grade students receive on a knowledge test at the end of the field trip, and the independent variable is the type of field trip they participated in. As the researcher is comparing the means of these two different groups, they will use a two sample t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "When conducting a t-test, a researcher is interested in determining if the test statistic exceeds the critical values of the test. The null hypothesis for such a test can be written as follows: $Ho: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$ \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the alternate hypothesis for such a test will depend on whether it is a two-tailed or one-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-tailed test simply looks to see if there is a difference between the means at all. Looking at the distribution of sample differences, we would seek to see if our computed test statistic lay past the critical value at either end of the distribution. In such a case, the critical value would be associated with an $\\alpha/2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Two-tail t-test](media/twotail.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-tailed test looks to see if there is a difference between means at one end of the distribution. This would be used if the question being asked assumed that the mean of one sample was higher or lower than the other. We would look to see if our computed test statistic lay past the critical value at one end of the distribution. In such a case, the critical value would be associated with the full $\\alpha$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "![One-tail t-test](media/onetail.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternate hypothesis can be written as follows depending on the type of test being conducted:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two-tailed Test: $Ha: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\neq 0 $\n",
    "* Left-tailed Test: $Ha: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 < 0 $\n",
    "* Right-tailed Test: $Ha: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 > 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "If our computed t-statistic is within the critical region for our test, then we have found a statistically significant result. We can reject our null hypothesis, and the two groups are different from one another based on our chosen alpha level. In the case of conducting a t-test in r, if the p-value is below an assumed $\\alpha$, we can also reject our null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In r, the function for t-test is `t.test(y~x,data=dataset, var.equal=TRUE)` where\n",
    "* `y`= numeric variable\n",
    "* `x`= treatment group\n",
    "* `dataset`should be replaced with the name of the variable storing your data.\n",
    "* You can use the `var.equal = TRUE` option to specify equal variances and a pooled variance estimate, or remove it if you believe variances to be unequal. \n",
    "* You can use the `alternative=\"less\"` or `alternative=\"greater\"` option to specify a one tailed test if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test\n",
    "A t-test, however, is not appropriate in every case. T-tests are based on assumptions about the larger population that the samples have been drawn from. In this way, t-tests are **parametric tests**. As specified above, our dataset must therefore fulfill a number of basic assumptions in order for us to conduct a t-test. But what can be done if our dataset does not meet all of these assumptions? \n",
    "\n",
    "The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test is a **nonparametric statistical test** used to compare two independent samples of ordinal or continuous data. It assesses whether there is a significant difference between the medians of the two groups by ranking all the observations in the combined sample and then comparing the sum of ranks for each group. It is an alternative to the two-sample t-test when normality and equal variances assumptions are violated, or when the sample size is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test only tests for a difference in the median values of the two groups. Additionally, it assumes that the two samples are independent and randomly sampled."
