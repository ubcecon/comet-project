    "The northern spotted owl is under extreme pressure in British Columbia due to forestry activities and competition from the barred owl, which only recently migrated to the area. Only [six wild owls](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/spotted-owl-protections-bc-new-chick-breeding-program-1.5131548) have been confirmed to remain in BC, located exclusively within old growth forest in the lower Fraser Basin. This is thought to represent a decline of around 99\\% from their precolonial numbers.\n",
    "The BC government is attempting to protect remaining owl habitat and increase owl numbers through a [captive breeding and release program](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/species-ecosystems-at-risk/implementation/conservation-projects-partnerships/northern-spotted-owl).\n",

    "\n",
    "The number of owls in Washington, Oregon, and California is much higher than in BC. In these regions, the owls are considered threatened (as the population is low and decreasing), but not endangered. To identify potential northern spotted owl habitat for protection from harvesting or barred owl colonization, it is necessary to characterize the features of ideal nesting trees for northern spotted owls."

    "### One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **one-way ANOVA** is used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between three or more groups. This statistical test looks at the overall variability of data values in order to compare the equality of means. However, there are some basic assumptions that must be fulfilled before using this hypothesis test:\n",
    "* The populations from which the sample groups are taken are assumed to be normal.\n",
    "* Samples are randomly selected and independent.\n",
    "* The populations are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances).\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Example:** A researcher is interested in different approaches to weight loss and would like to determine if there is a difference between three different diets (ketogenic, low-carb and paleo). In order to test this, they randomly assign a group of 60 people to the three diets of interest and track their overall weight loss over a six-month period. The dependent variable is weight loss in this study, and the independent variable is diet type. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between means of the three diet groups, and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between at least two groups in the study. So long as the three fundamental assumptions listed above are met, a one-way ANOVA would be appropriate to use in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is used to test general, rather than specific differences between means. That is, it tests if a difference exists between groups, but cannot tell us *which* pairs of groups have differences between them. As such, the null hypothesis is: $Ho: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3$. Meanwhile, the alternative hypothesis is: $Ha: \\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j$ for some $i \\neq j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test is conducted by computing an F-statistic and comparing it against a critical value determined using the F-distribution. The F-statistic is a ratio of the mean square variance between groups and within groups: \n",
    "\n",
    "$F = \\frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no difference between the groups being tested, then the between-group variance and the within-group variance will be roughly equal and thus a value close to 1 would be expected. For an explanation of how to compute this test statistic by hand, please consult [this resource by openstax](https://openstax.org/books/introductory-statistics/pages/13-2-the-f-distribution-and-the-f-ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-distribution is a family of curves based on the degrees of freedom (df) of the variance of the numerator, and the df of the denominator:\n",
    "\n",
    "![F-Distribution (Credit openstax](media/f_dist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution has some key properties:\n",
    "* The curve is skewed to the right.\n",
    "* There is a different curve for each set of dfs.\n",
    "* The F-statistic is always greater than or equal to zero.\n",
    "* As the degrees of freedom for the numerator and for the denominator get larger, the curve approximates the normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your computed F-statistic is greater than the F-critical value determined from the F-distribution table, then you have found a statistically significant result and at least one group differs significantly from another group based on your chosen alpha level. We will be conducting ANOVA using r and the F-statistic will be calculated along with a p-value associated with it. In the case of conducting an ANOVA in r, if the p-value is below an assumed $\\alpha$ of .05, you can reject your null hypothesis. However, if you are conducting a one-way ANOVA by hand, please consult an \n",

As discussed, ANOVA does not determine which groups a significant difference exists between. The Tukey test is used to determine this through pairwise comparisons.\n",
