    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we will investigate how El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects floods and snowfall in Canada's Fraser River system. We will apply regression analysis to snowpack and discharge data in the Fraser basin. This will allow us to determine if these data indicate a shift in precipitation characteristics through time, and to what extent precipitation patterns may depend on ENSO. Many of Earth's major river basins are affected by climate change and ENSO. [See for example the IPCC reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/).\n",

    "### Correlation and Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation** is a statistical method to determine whether a relationship exists between two variables, as well as the direction and strength of that relationship. It is used to test the statistical significance of that association. Meanwhile, **regression** is a statistical method to describe the nature of the relationship between variables. Precisely, it has predictive value. In short, we use correlation to represent a linear relationship between two variables, while we use regression to produce a line of best fit that will allow us to estimate the value of one variable based on the other. However, there are some basic assumptions that must be fulfilled before conducting correlation or regression analysis:\n",
    "- The variables under investigation are continuous.\n",
    "- The datasets have a bivariate normal distribution.\n",
    "- The data demonstrate **homoscedasticity**, or the size of the error term is the same for all values of the independent variable.\n",
    "- The data follow a linear relationship.\n",
    "- Outliers have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a researcher will begin with correlation analysis even if they intend to conduct a regression. If the outcome of the correlation analysis indicates that a statistically significant relationship exists, a regression analysis can then be conducted to allow for prediction and extrapolation. Generally speaking, analysis is conducted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visualize your data using a scatterplot to determine if it meets the basic assumptions of correlation and regression analysis.\n",
    "2. Determine the null and alternative hypotheses for your correlation analysis.\n",
    "3. Calculate the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC, r).\n",
    "4. Determine the strength and direction of the relationship.\n",
    "5. Calculate the significance of $r$.\n",
    "6. If $r$ is significant, reject $H_0$ and continue to step 7 to conduct regression analysis. \n",
    "7. Calculate the equation for the line of best fit.\n",
    "8. Calculate the coefficient of determination ($r^2$).\n",
    "9. Make predictions and extrapolate values based on the regression line equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independent and Dependent Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple correlation and regression we work with two variables:\n",
    "* **Independent variable (x):** This is the variable that is changed or controlled by the researcher in order to test its effects on the dependent variable. In some cases the researcher may not control or manipulate this variable, but it is the variable which is thought to affect the dependent variable. \n",
    "* **Dependent variable (y):** This is the variable being tested and measured by the researcher and is not manipulated or controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing Correlation Using a Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between our independent (x) and dependent (y) variables is visualized using a scatterplot in correlation analysis. A positive correlation will result in the value of y increasing as x increases, while a negative correlation will result in the value of y decreasing as x increases. The degree to which data pairs are spread or tightly clustered is also indicative of the strength of the relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Correlation (diagrammm.com, creative commons license)](media/scatterplots.PNG) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables is computed as the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC, $r$). It can vary in value from -1 (high negative linear relationship) to +1 (high positive linear relationship). We will determine $r$ in this lab using the `cor.test` function; however, the equation to calculate the PPMCC statistic is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\displaystyle r = \\frac{n(\\sum xy) - (\\sum x)(\\sum y)}{\\sqrt{[n(\\sum x^2) - (\\sum x)^2][n(\\sum y^2) - (\\sum y)^2]}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once $r$ has been calculated, it is then important to determine if it is indicative of a statistically significant relationship. There are multiple ways to conduct a hypothesis test to determine the statistical significance of $r$; however, in this lab we will determine the p-values associated with a t-test statistic and compare it to our alpha of 0.05. For such a test, our null and alternative hypotheses will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_0: \\rho = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_1: \\rho \\neq 0\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If our computed p-value is less than the critical value, then there is a statistically significant correlation present and we can reject our null hypothesis. We will be using the `cor.test` function to determine this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "If the result of our correlation analysis is statistically significant, we can conduct a regression analysis to calculate a line of best fit to provide a model for prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Line of Best Fit (Lane onlinestatbook.com)](media/regressionline.PNG) \n",
    "\n",
    "The line of best fit (or the \"least squares line\") visualizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from each data point to the line, such that this distance is kept to a minimum. In addition, the closer the data points are to the line, the better the fit and the predictive capacity of the regression equation. The equation for the line of best fit is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y' = a + bx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such that `y'`: predicted value of y; `a`: y-intercept; `b`: slope; `x`: value of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the coefficient of determination, $r^2$, can also be calculated by simply squaring our PPMCC value to provide a measure of the variation of the dependent variable that is explained by the regression line and the independent variable. In other words, this is a ratio of explained variation to the total variation present. The remaining variation in the y variable that cannot be explained by x can also be calculated as $1 - r^2$, and this is called the coefficient of non-determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the value of y for a given value of x, we simply replace `x` with the given value and solve for `y'`. However, it is important to remember that the power of this prediction is directly related to our $r^2$ value. Additionally, making a prediction outside of the bounds of our data (e.g. extrapolation) can be erroneous‚Äîbe cautious. \n"
