    "In this tutorial, we will be working with some real-world data: the 2019 Survey of Financial Security, provided by Statistics Canada[<sup id=\"fn1s\">1</sup>](#fn1). First, we will import data into our notebook. We are going to give a brief review of some of the features of R (feel free to skip this if you are already familiar with R or review the introduction notebooks if you are in need of a more comprehensive review).\n",
    "In R, we import data using different commands, which are stored in **libraries** that other developers of R have created for us.  Let's import some of the most important libraries now.  \n",

    "We can do this in a Jupyter notebook by selecting a cell and hitting `shift+enter` or by pressing the `play` button in the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**: information is stored in cells in a notebook.  However, cells run independently; so, if you run a later cell it doesn't re-evaluate previous cells.  You have to re-run them before you can use the results.  You can re-run all the cells in a notebook with the \"fast forward\" button.\n",

    "As an aside, in this course we try (as much as possible) to use R packages which are part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of packages.  This is because they are well-supported, consistent, and commonly used in data sciences.  There are (usually) other packages that provide similar functions.\n",

    "### Importing Data into R\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in an econometric project is to import, tidy, and examine your data.  For this project, we will be using data from the 2019 Survey of Financial Security (SFS), provided by Statistics Canada (see the license notes).  This is _real data_ on real Canadians.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will always work with data that is **tidy**.  This is a data-science term that refers to data with a particular format or shape.  Specifically, tidy data is rectangular data in which:\n",
    "* Each row represents one observation\n",
    "* Each column represents a single variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine this as a spreadsheet in a program like Excel.  This is the way most statistical programs like to receive data - but it _isn't_ a property of the data itself.  It is only a representation; there can be other kinds of representations.  For example, a panel data set might have each row as a unit (e.g. country) and each column might represent a variable in a year (e.g. unemployment in 2016, unemployment in 2017, etc.).  Often, when we work with real-world data we have to reshape it in order for it to be usable - but in this course, we won't worry about that just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be stored in many different file formats (which encode how information is stored), which must be interpreted by our statistical programs. For example, data files with a `.dta` are formatted for Stata,  data files with a `.csv` suffix are formatted as comma-seperated values, and data files with an `.Rda` suffix are formatted for R. This is referred to as **importing** data. There are different methods for importing data in different formats; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `read_dta()`: Importing data from a ```.dta``` file: this is data that was created by the statistical software STATA and is commonly used in economics.\n",
    "* `read.csv()`: Importing data from a delimited text file: this is data which is in a text format, but where the columns are *delimited* or seperated by a special character.  For example, the ```.csv``` (comma-separated variable) format is text, but where the columns are separated by a comma.\n",
    "* `load()`: Importing data from an ```.Rda``` file: this is data that was created by the statistical software R and is commonly used in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these formats has a special **function** associated with it. Functions are commands, stored in R packages, that tell R to do things.  In fact, you've already seen one!  The ```library(...)``` function imports whatever package is in the brackets into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing our ```.dta``` file into memory, using the ```read_dta``` function.  When we read things into memory, we normally want to use them later, so we have to give them a name.  Let's call this ```SFS_data``` so we can refer to it later on."

In R, datasets are called *data frames* - this particular one is a special type of data frame called a _tibble_ (like, table).  We don't need to get into too many details about data frames, but basically they collect and organize all of the variables and observations.  Many functions in R need information to be organized into a data frame so that it can be computed.  You will see examples of these later on.\n",

For complex reasons that we won't get into here, women in many societies have historically and continue to experience economic inequality on the basis of their gender. In fact, many studies show that there is gender income gap and gender wealth gap, despite the fact that women are an important part of workforce. \n",

    "What factors contribute to the gender gap? Here we are going to explore the wealth gap between male lead households and female lead households \n",

A different way to ask this is: given our data, what percent of the time would we except this gap to appear randomly? This describes a p-value, so first we will perform a t-test, to get this value. Now if this p-value indicates a significant gap in wealth, we can go on to ask what is causing this wealth gap.\n",

    "3. **Difference in inherited wealth** between male and female lead households (ie, female lead households might inherit less wealth (regardless of income).\n",
    "4. **Difference in economic obstacles** faced by male and female lead households (ie, female lead households might face additional obstacles in building wealth or accessing credit).\n",

    "We'll be exploring this topic for the next three modules. In this module, we'll see if there is a significant wealth gap, and what causes it, which may involve investigating the income gap between male and female lead households. First off, we're going to compute the average family wealth. Then we compute the average family wealth conditional on being a female lead household vs a male lead households. Next we will do a t-test to see if the wealth gap is significant. Finally, we will briefly investigate what is causing the wealth gap."

    "> **Advanced Note**: _piping_ The above example uses a special R command called a **pipe operator** (``%>%``).  Mechanically, what piping does is insert the object before the pipe into the object after the pipe.  For example, if we have ``z <- f(x,y)`` we could write this using pipes as ``z <- x %>% f(y)``.  Piping is really most useful when you are chaining (piping) a series of commands together.  You can think of a pipe as saying \"_and then_\" followed by a command.  The item before the pipe will be inputted into the next command.  This allows you to do complex data manipulation in a way that is readable.\n",

The gender-wealth gap is widest for university graduates, with male-lead family has 38.54% more wealth than female-lead family. We can make this even more clear by adding a new variable (``university``) to our dataset.  Frequently, we will want to make new variables to help us analyze the results, especially when a variable is more complicated than we would like it to be.\n",
