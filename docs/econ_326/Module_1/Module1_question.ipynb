    "* Each row represents one observation\n",
    "* Each column represents a single variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine this as a spreadsheet in a program like Excel.  This is the way most statistical programs like to receive data - but it _isn't_ a property of the data itself.  It is only a representation; there can be other kinds of representations.  For example, a panel data set might have each row as a unit (e.g. country) and each column might represent a variable in a year (e.g. unemployment in 2016, unemployment in 2017, etc.).  Often, when we work with real-world data we have to reshape it in order for it to be usable - but in this course, we won't worry about that just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be stored in many different file formats (which encode how information is stored), which must be interpreted by our statistical programs. For example, data files with a `.dta` are formatted for Stata,  data files with a `.csv` suffix are formatted as comma-seperated values, and data files with an `.Rda` suffix are formatted for R. This is referred to as **importing** data. There are different methods for importing data in different formats; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `read_dta()`: Importing data from a ```.dta``` file: this is data that was created by the statistical software STATA and is commonly used in economics.\n",
    "* `read.csv()`: Importing data from a delimited text file: this is data which is in a text format, but where the columns are *delimited* or seperated by a special character.  For example, the ```.csv``` (comma-separated variable) format is text, but where the columns are separated by a comma.\n",
    "* `load()`: Importing data from an ```.Rda``` file: this is data that was created by the statistical software R and is commonly used in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these formats has a special **function** associated with it. Functions are commands, stored in R packages, that tell R to do things.  In fact, you've already seen one!  The ```library(...)``` function imports whatever package is in the brackets into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing our ```.dta``` file into memory, using the ```read_dta``` function.  When we read things into memory, we normally want to use them later, so we have to give them a name.  Let's call this ```SFS_data``` so we can refer to it later on."

In R, datasets are called *data frames* - this particular one is a special type of data frame called a _tibble_ (like, table).  We don't need to get into too many details about data frames, but basically they collect and organize all of the variables and observations.  Many functions in R need information to be organized into a data frame so that it can be computed.  You will see examples of these later on.\n",
