    "In this notebook, we will explore several important issues in multiple regression models, and explore how to identify, evaluate, and correct them where appropriate.  It is important to remember that there can be many other issues that arise in specific regression models; as you learn more about econometrics and create your own research questions, different issues will arise.  Consider these as \"examples\" for some of the most common issues that arise in regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-collinearity is a surprisingly common issue in applied regression analysis, where several explanatory variables are correlated to each other. For example, suppose we are interested at regressing one's marriage rate against years of education and annual income. In this case, the two explanatory variables income and years of education are highly correlated. It refers to the situation where a variable is \"overdetermined\" by the other variables in a model, which will result in less reliable regression output. For example, if we have a high coefficient on education. How certain are we that this coefficient was not the result of having a high annual income as well? Let's look at this problem mathematically; in calculating an OLS estimation, you are estimating a relationship like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = \\beta_a + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You find the estimates of the coefficients in this model using OLS; i.e. solving an equation like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{b_0, b_1} \\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - b_0 -b_1 X_i)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the OLS regression assumptions, this has a unique solution; i.e you can find unique values for $b_0$ and $b_1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you wrote an equation like this:\n",
    " $$\\beta a=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 $$\n",
    " We can then rewrite  as $$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 X_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This _seems_ like it would be fine, but remember what you are doing: trying to find a _line_ of best fit.  The problem is that this equation does not define a unique line; the \"intercept\" is $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$.  There are two \"parameters\" ($\\beta_0, \\beta_1$) for a single \"characteristics\" (the intercept).  This means that the resulting OLS problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{b_0, b_1, b_2} \\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - b_0 -b_1 -b_2 X_i)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Does not have a unique solution.  In algebraic terms, it means you can find many representations of a line with two intercept parameters.  This is referred to in econometrics as a lack of **identification**; multicollinearity is one way that identification can fail in regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this in the following example, which fits an OLS estimate of ``wealth`` and ``income_before_tax`` then compares the fit to a regression with two intercepts.  Try changing the values to see what happens."

    "Okay, you're probably thinking, that makes sense - but just don't write down an equation like that.  After all, it seems somewhat artificial that we added an extra intercept term.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, multicollinearly can occur with _any_ set of variables in the model; not just the intercept.  For example, suppose you have a multiple regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_ i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1,i} + \\beta_2  X_{2,i} + \\beta_3  X_{3,i} + \\epsilon_i$$\n",

    "$$X_{1,i} = 0.4 X_{2,i} + 12 X_{3,i}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "When, we could then re-write the equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_ i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (0.4 X_{2,i} + 12 X_{3,i}) + \\beta_2  X_{2,i} + \\beta_3  X_{3,i} + \\epsilon_i$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The same problem is now occuring, but with $X_2$ and $X_3$: the slope coefficients depend on a free parameter ($\\beta_1$).  You cannot uniquely find the equation of a line (c.f. plane) with this kind of equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically what is happening, is you are trying to solve a system of equations for 3 variables (or n variables), but only 2 (or n-1) are used in the equation (are independent). So what would you do, well you would leave one of the dependent variables out, so you could solve for all of your variables, this is exactly what R does.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also intuitively see the condition here: multicollinearity occurs when you can express one variable as a _linear_ combination of the other variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is sometimes referred to as **perfect multicollinearity**, since the variable is _perfectly_ expressed as a linear combination of the other variable.\n",
    "* The linearity is important because this is a linear model; you can have similar issues in other models, but it has a special name in linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perfect Multicollinearity in Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, most statistical packages (like R) will automatically detect, warn, and remove perfectly multicollinear variables from a model; this is because the algorithm they use to solve problems like the OLS estimation equation detects the problem and avoids a \"crash\".  This is fine, from a mathematical perspective - since mathematically the two results are the same (in a well-defined sense, as we saw above).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, from an economic perspective this is very bad - it indicates that there was a problem with the _model_ that you defined in the first place.  Usually, this means one of three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You included a set of variables which were, in combination, identical.  For example, including \"family size\" and then \"number of children\" and \"number of adults\" in a regression\n",
    "2. You did not understand the data well enough, and variables had less variation than you thought they did - conditional on the other variables in the model.  For example, maybe you thought people in the dataset could have both graduate and undergraduate degrees - so there was variation in \"higher than high-school\" but that wasn't true\n",
    "3. You wrote down a model which was poorly defined in terms of the variables.  For example, you including all levels of a dummy variable, or included the same variable measured in two different units (wages in dollars and wages in 1000s of dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, you need to go back to your original regression model and re-evaluate what you are trying to do in order to simplify the model or correct the error.  \n",

    "\n",
    "$$X_{1,i} = 0.4 X_{2,i} + 12 X_{3,i}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in this relationship it holds _for all_ values of $i$.  However, what if it held for _nearly_ all $i$ instead?  In that case, we would still have a solution to the equation... but there would be a problem.  Let's look at this in the simple regression case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's suppose that $X_i$ is \"almost\" collinear with $\\beta_0$.  To be precise, suppose that $X_i = 15$ for $k$-% of the data ($k$ will be large) and $X_i = 20$ for $(1-k)$-% of the data.  This is _almost_ constant, and so it is _almost_ collinear with $\\beta_0$ (the constant).  Let's also make the values of $Y_i$ so that $Y_i(X_i) = X_i + \\epsilon_i$ (so $\\beta_1 = 1$), and we will set $\\sigma_Y = 1$\n",

    "As you can see, when $Var(X_i)$ goes down, $\\sigma_X$ falls, and the value of $r$ falls; intuitively, when $k$ rises, the variance will go to zero, which makes $r$ go to zero as well (since there's no variation).  You can then see that $s_b$ diverges to infinity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make this more precise.  In this model, how does $Var(X_i)$ depend on $k$?  Well, first notice that $\\bar{X_i} = 15\\cdot k + 20 \\cdot (1-k)$.  Then,\n",

This is pretty typical: when you transform a model by changing the variables, what you are really doing is adjusting how you think the data process should be described so that it's no longer heteroskedastic.  If you aren't correct with this, you won't fix the problem.\n",

There are actually a number of different versions of these (which you don't need to know about), but they are all called **HC** or **hetereoskedasticity-corrected** standard errors.  In economics, we typically adopt White's versions of these (called **HC1** in the literature); these are often referred to in economics papers as \"robust\" standard errors (for short).\n",

For example, we previously regressed ``gender`` (of male or female) in these models to investigate the wealth gap.  However, this can easily cause a problem when estimated using OLS - the value of $D_i$ must be 0 or 1, and the fitted values (which are probabilities) must be between 0 and 1.\n",

    "However, _nothing_ in the OLS model forces this to be true.  If you estimate a value for $\\beta_1$, if you have an $X_{1,i}$ that is high or low enough, the fitted values will be above or below 1 or 0 (respectively).  This implies that _mechanically_ you have heteroskedasticity because high or low values of the explanatory variables will ALWAYS fit worse than intermediate values.
