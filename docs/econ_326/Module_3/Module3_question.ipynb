    "## Part 1: Introducing Multiple Regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you are familiar with the simple regression model and its relationship to the comparison-of-means $t$-test.  However, most econometric analysis doesn't use simple regression - this is because, in general, economic data and models are far too complicated to be summarized with a single relationship.  One of the features of most economic datasets is a complex, multi-dimensional relationship between different variables.  This leads to the two key motivations for **multiple regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, it can improve the *predictive* properties of a regression model, by introducing other variables that play an important econometric role in the relationship being studied.\n",
    "* Second, it allows the econometrician to *differentiate* the importance of different variables in a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "This second motivation is usually part of **causal analysis** when we believe that our model has an interpretation as a cause-and-effect.  However, even if it does not, it is still useful to understand which variables are \"driving\" the relationship in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the following plot, which depict the relationships between ``wealth``, ``gender`` and ``education``.  In the top panel, the colour of each cell is the (average) log of ``wealth``.  In the bottom panel, the size each of each circle is the number of households in that combination of categories. "

    "### Control Variables: What Do They Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "One very common term you may have heard, especially in the context of a multiple regression model, is the idea of a **control variable**.  In a multiple regression model, control variables are just explanatory variables - there is nothing special about how they are included.  However, there *is* something special about how we think about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a control variable refers to how we *think about* a regression model, and in particular the different variables.  Recall that the interpretation of a coefficient in a multiple regression model is the effect of that variable *holding constant* the other variables.  This often referred to as **controlling** for the values of those other variables - we are not allowing their relationship with the variable in question, and the outcome variable, to affect our measurement of the result.  This is very common when we are discussing a *cause and effect* relationship - control is essential to these kinds of models.  However, it is also valuable even when we are just thinking about a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how this works directly if you think about a multiple regression as a series of \"explanations\" for the outcome variable.  Each variable, one-by-one \"explains\" part of the outcome variable.  When we \"control\" for a variable, we remove the part of the outcome that can be explained by that variable alone.  In terms of our model, this refers to the residual.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we must remember that our control variable *also* explains part of the other variables, so we must \"control\" for it as well.\n",
