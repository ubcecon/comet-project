    "> _Think Deeper_: What do you see here?  Is there anything about this relationship that sticks out to you?  Why does it have the shape it does?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can probably tell that there is definitely some relationship between wages and after-tax income - but it can be difficult to visualize using a scatterplot alone.  There are far too many points to make out a discernable pattern or relationship here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where a **regression model** comes in.  A regression model specifies the relationship between two variables.  For example, a linear relationship would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1I_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W_i$ is wealth of family $i$, and $I_i$ is their after-tax income.  In econometrics, we typically refer to $W_i$ as the **outcome** variable, and $I_i$ as the **explanatory** variable; you may have also heard the terms *dependent* and *independent* variables respectively, but these aren't actually very good descriptions of what these variables are in econometrics which is why we won't use them here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A model like this is our description of what this relationship is - but it depends on two unknowns: $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are **parameters** of the model: they are numbers that determine the relationship (intercept and slope, respectively) between $W_i$ and $I_i$ \n",
    "* This is a _linear_ relationship because the model we have specified uses coefficients that are characteristic of linear model formulas - note that there are many other kinds of models beyond the linear type seen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unlikely, if not impossible, for the relationship we observe here to completely explain everything about our data.  We also need to include a term which captures everything that is _not_ described by the relationship we described in the model.  This is called the *residual* term (meaning \"leftover\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* The $\\epsilon_i$ is the **residual**: it is a component that corresponds to the part of the data which is _not_ described by the model\n",
    "* Residual terms will usually have certain assumed properties that allow us to estimate the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, you can think about a regression as two parts: the part of the relationship explained by your model ($W_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 I_i$) and the part which is not explained ($\\epsilon_i$).  The process of \"fitting\" or estimating a regression model refers to finding values for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ such that as little as possible of the model is explained by the residual term.  We write the complete regression equation by combining the two parts of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 I_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of regression analysis is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate this equation (and especially the model parameters) as accurately as possible.\n",
    "2. Learn about the relationship between $W_i$ and $I_i$ from the results of that estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to define \"as accurately as possible\" and similarly there are many ways to \"estimate\" the equation.  In this course, we use *ordinary least squares* (OLS) as our estimation method which can be understood as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\hat{\\beta_0},\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\arg \\min_{b_0,b_1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (M_i - b_0 - b_1 W_i)^2 =\\arg \\min_{b_0,b_1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (e_i)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is just the calculus way of writing \"choose $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ (call them $\\hat{\\beta_0},\\hat{\\beta_1}$) such that they minimize the sum of the squared residuals\". Ultimately, the goal of doing a regression is to explain as much as possible using the parameters ($\\beta_0, \\beta_1$) and as little as possible using $\\epsilon_i$. Through this equation, we have transformed our statistical problem into a calculus problem, one that can can be solved, for example, by taking derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many ways to solve this estimation problem - most of which are built into R. Before getting into how we can estimate using R commands, we'll discuss on how we can estimate manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Manual Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think about the residuals as a gauge of error in our model (remember we want to think about the error in absolute terms, we can look at the scatterplot and guess how the model might perform based on how small or large the residuals are from the regression line. As you can probably imagine, this is not the most efficient nor the most accurate way to solve our estimate problem! \n",
