    "## Part 1: Interactions in Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common extensions to multiple regression models is to include **interaction** terms.  What is an interaction term?  It's basically a term which represents the product of two (or more) variables in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a dummy variable for being a female ($F_i$) and a dummy variable for having a university degree ($D_i$), the _interaction_ of these two variables is the product $D_i \\times F_i$.  This can seem complicated but it also has a simple interpretation: it is now a dummy for being _both_ a female and having a university degree.  You can see why this is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D_i \\times F_i = 1 \\iff D_i = 1 \\text{ and } F_i = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why these terms are so important for understanding regressions: they provide us with a simple way to describe and study how _combinations_ of our explanatory variables impact our model.  These variables enter into our regression models in exactly the same way as usual:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 F_i + \\beta_2 D_i + \\beta_3 D_i \\times F_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can see that this is just a multiple regression model - the only difference is that one of the variables is a combination of the other variables.  From an estimation perspective, there's no issue - you can use OLS to estimate a model with interaction terms, just like normal.  However, as we have seen, there are important differences when it comes to the _interpretation_ of these models.  Let's learn more about this in this worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are (in general) two ways to create interactions in R: (i) manually (i.e. creating a new variables which is $D_i \\times F_i$ then adding it to the regression), or (ii) using the built-in tools in R.  However, method (i) is a trap!  You should never use this method.  Why?  There are two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The main reason is that R (and you, the analyst) lose track of the relationship between the created interaction variable and the underlying variables.  This means that you can't use other tools to analyze these relationship (there are many packages such as ``margins`` which allow you to investigate complex interaction) which is a big loss.  You also can't perform post-regression analysis on the underlying variables in a simple way anymore.\n",
    "2.  The second reason is that it's easy to make mistakes.  You might define the interaction incorrectly (possible!).  However, it's more of an issue if later on you change the underlying variables and then forget to re-compute the interactions.  It also makes your code harder to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line: don't do it.  Interaction in R are easy to create: you simply use the ``:`` or ``*`` operator when defining an interaction term.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``:`` operator creates the interaction(s) of the two variables in question\n",
    "* The ``*`` operation creates the interactions(s) _and_ the main effects of the variables as well\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better: if you are interacting two qualitative (factor) variables, it will automatically \"expand\" the interaction into every possible combination of the variables.  A lot less work!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's look at a regression model which interacts gender and education. Before we run regression, let's first summarize education into 'university' and 'non-university'."

    "There are a few important things to notice about this regression result.  First, take a close look at the terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``genderFemale`` this is the main effect for being a female.  You _might_ immediately say that this is the impact of being a female - but this is _not true_.  Why?  Because female shows up in two places!  We have to be a little more careful - this is the effect of being a female in the base group (non-university) \n",
    "* ``genderFemale:EducationUniversity`` this is the interaction effect of being a female and having a university degree.  Basically, family with female (university degree) as main earner accumulates $143,396+324,112=467,508$ less wealth, compared with male counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this interpretation in the regression model itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 F_i + \\beta_2 D_i + \\beta_3 F_i \\times D_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\Delta W_i}{\\Delta F_i} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 D_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The marginal effect of being a female-lead household _changes_ depending on what the value of $D_i$ is!  For non-university degree (the level where $D_i = 0$) it's $\\beta_1$.  For university degree (the level where $D_i =1$), it's $\\beta_1 + \\beta_3$.  This is why, in an interaction model, it doesn't really make sense to talk about the \"effect of female\" - because there isn't a single, immutable effect.  It is different for different education degrees!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can talk about the _average_ effect, which is just $\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 \\bar{D_i}$ - but that's not really what people are asking about when they are discussing the gender effect, in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it's very important to carefully think about a regression model with interaction terms - the model may seem simple to estimate, but the interpretation is more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactions with Continuous Variables\n",

One approach would be to run the model only for men, and only for women, and then compare - but this isn't a good idea.

    "The reason is actually approximation.  Consider the following _non-linear_ model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = f(X_i) + e_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is truly non-linear (and not just in terms of the parameters).  How can we estimate this model?  It's hard!  There are techniques to estimate complex models like this, but how far can we get with good-old OLS?  The answer is - provided that $f$ is \"smooth\" - pretty far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think back to introductory calculus; you might remember a theorem called [Taylor's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem).  It says that a smoothly differentiable function can be arbitrarily well-approximated (about a point) by a polynomial expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \\cdots + \\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k + R_k(x)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Look closely at this expression.  Most of the terms (like $f'(a)$) are constants.  In fact, you can show that this can be written like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\beta_k x^k + r$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Which is a linear regression model!  What this say is actually very important: linear regression models can be viewed as _approximations_ to nonlinear regressions, provided we have enough polynomial terms.  This is one complication: the error term is definitely not uncorrelated.  You can learn more about how to address this issue in other courses, but at the most the omitted variable bias is relatively small as $k \\to \\infty$."
