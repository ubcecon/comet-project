        "\n",
        "For example, if we have a dummy variable for being a female ($F_i$) and\n",

        "*interaction* of these two variables is the product $D_i \\times F_i$.\n",
        "This can seem complicated but it also has a simple interpretation: it is\n",
        "now a dummy for being *both* a female and having a university degree.\n",
        "You can see why this is true:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ D_i \\times F_i = 1 \\iff D_i = 1 \\text{ and } F_i = 1$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why these terms are so important for understanding regressions:\n",
        "they provide us with a simple way to describe and study how\n",
        "*combinations* of our explanatory variables impact our model. These\n",
        "variables enter into our regression models in exactly the same way as\n",

        "\n",
        "There are (in general) two ways to create interactions in R: (i)\n",

        "    relationship between the created interaction variable and the\n",
        "    underlying variables. This means that you can’t use other tools to\n",
        "    analyze these relationship (there are many packages such as\n",
        "    `margins` which allow you to investigate complex interaction) which\n",
        "    is a big loss. You also can’t perform post-regression analysis on\n",
        "    the underlying variables in a simple way anymore.\n",
        "2.  The second reason is that it’s easy to make mistakes. You might\n",
        "    define the interaction incorrectly (possible!). However, it’s more\n",
        "    of an issue if later on you change the underlying variables and then\n",
        "    forget to re-compute the interactions. It also makes your code\n",
        "    harder to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bottom line: don’t do it. Interaction in R are easy to create: you\n",
        "simply use the `:` or `*` operator when defining an interaction term.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The `:` operator creates the interaction(s) of the two variables in\n",
