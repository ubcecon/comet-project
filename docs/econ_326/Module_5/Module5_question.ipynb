        "\n",

        "There are two reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The main reason is that R (and you, the analyst) lose track of the\n",
        "    relationship between the created interaction variable and the\n",
        "    underlying variables. This means that you can’t use other tools to\n",
        "    analyze these relationship (there are many packages such as\n",
        "    `margins` which allow you to investigate complex interaction) which\n",
        "    is a big loss. You also can’t perform post-regression analysis on\n",
        "    the underlying variables in a simple way anymore.\n",
        "2.  The second reason is that it’s easy to make mistakes. You might\n",
        "    define the interaction incorrectly (possible!). However, it’s more\n",
        "    of an issue if later on you change the underlying variables and then\n",
        "    forget to re-compute the interactions. It also makes your code\n",
        "    harder to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bottom line: don’t do it. Interaction in R are easy to create: you\n",
        "simply use the `:` or `*` operator when defining an interaction term.\n",

        "-   The `:` operator creates the interaction(s) of the two variables in\n",
        "    question\n",
