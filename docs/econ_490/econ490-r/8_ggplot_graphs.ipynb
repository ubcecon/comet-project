    "## 8.1 General Points about Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Stata, you will notice that graphs in R are completely different. The most important and widely used package for data visualization in R is `ggplot2`. This package operates under the premise that every graph can be decomposed into the following layers: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data : the very base of every graph, where it comes from.\n",
    "* Mapping: informs graphics which variables are going to be part of some graphical property (e.g. column 3 of the data is going to be the dependent variable and y-axis of some graph).\n",
    "* Statistics: transforms the input variables to be displayed (e.g. graphs the means of some particular columns, counts the number of observations in some category).\n",
    "* Scales: indicates the relationship between variables and properties (e.g. we want to associate different colours with different values of a region variable). \n",
    "* Geometries: a key layer of the  graph structure. The geometry indicates the general aesthetic of the graph (e.g. a line, a polygon, etc). \n",
    "* Facets: this can be used to split data into different sub-plots.\n",
    "* Coordinates: dictates the positioning of variables. It thinks of the world as an X and Y axis by default, but more generally there can be more complicated structures (e.g. cartography!).\n",
    "* Theme: deals with other graphic information that is not related to the previous parts (e.g. background colour of our graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will look at how to construct a standard graph. You will notice how `ggplot2` tries to respect the above structure when constructing graphic information. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load in the data set that we've been using so far in these modules. Recall that this data set is simulating information for workers in the years 1982-2012 in a fake country where a training program was introduced in 2003 to boost their earnings.\n",

    "The first part of the argument, \"file_name.file_format\" is where we give our graphic a descriptive name and specify which file format we want our graphic to be saved in the Jupyter workspace. If we are saving to a specific folder, we can add this before the file name with a `/` in between to separate the two (example: `\"folder/file_name.file_format\"`). The format we choose may depend on the context we plan to use the visualization in. Images are typically stored in either raster or vector formats. \n",

A compressed format is \"lossy\" if the image cannot be perfectly recreated when loading and displaying, with the hope that the change is not noticeable. \"Lossless\" formats, on the other hand, allow a perfect display of the original image.\n",

    "Common raster file types:\n",

    "* BMP (.bmp): lossless, raw image data, no compression (rarely used)\n",
    "* TIFF (.tif, .tiff): typically lossless, no compression, used mostly in graphic arts, publishing\n",
    "* GIMP: open-source software\n",

    "Raster and vector images have advantages and disadvantages. A raster image of a fixed width and height takes the same amount of space and time to load regardless of what the image shows (the one caveat is that the compression algorithms may shrink the image more or run faster for certain images). A vector image takes space and time to load depending on how complex the image is, since the computer has to draw all the elements each time it is displayed. For example, if we have a scatter plot with 1 million points stored as an SVG file, it may take our computer some time to open the image. On the upside, with vector graphics we can zoom into/scale up the image as much as we like without it looking bad, while raster images eventually start to look “pixelated\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the argument, `my_plot`, specifies which plot in our analysis we'd like to export. The last key part of the argument, `width =` and `height =` specifies the dimensions of our image. Because we've tinkered with the graph output size using options (`repr.plot.width = 15, repr.plot.height = 9`) above in our code, we'll want to use these dimensions as we export to ensure that our visualization isn't cut off by R's default saving dimensions.\n",

    "Any change we may want to make to the geometry (in our case, to the points of the scatterplot) should be specified as options inside the function `geom_point`. By default, R uses a full circle as shape of the scatterplot. We can modify that to be a full triangle with the option `shape=24`. We can increase the size of the triangles to be three times as big as the default with the option `size=3`. In terms of colors, it is possible to call a color by its name in R. R stores 657 colors. You can find the full list by typing `colors()` or you can access it at [this link](https://r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names.html). If the color you desire is not available, you can input its RGB or HEX code. We can modify both the color of the border and the color of the filling. We can set the border to dark green with `color=\"darkgreen\"` and the filling to yellow using its corresponding HEX code with `fill=\"#f0e442\"`. When choosing colors, be mindful of colorblindness. You can learn more about accessible color combinations in [this website](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40).\n",

    "Since modifications to axes and titles concern the whole graph, they are added as an additional option to the object *figure1*. In the example below, we add labels and a title as inputs of the option `labs`.\n",

With them, we can demonstrate geographical, social, and political features of a particular place. For example, we can show elevation and temperature changes of a country. We can also show how population density or income changes throughout a region. During the 2020 USA presidential campaign, CNN showed a map of the United States divided by counties colored red, blue or white depending on what party the majority of the county voted for.
