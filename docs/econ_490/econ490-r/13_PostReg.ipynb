Even without that type of error, though, we might worry that the earnings growth of a small number of observations are driving the results of our analysis. If this is the case, we are producing an inaccurate analysis based on results that are not associated with the majority of our observations. \n",

If we include this variable in a regression that also includes an age variable for only years (e.g the baby's age would be coded as 1) then we would have the problem of multicollinearity.

We can think of several mechanisms for why this relationship might exist: for a young worker, as they age they get higher wages through increased experience in the job; for an older worker, as they age those wage increases will be smaller as there are smaller productity gains with each additional year working. In fact, if the productivity of workers decreaseas as they age, perhaps for reasons related to health, then it is possible to find a negative relationship between age and earning beyond a certain age; the relationship is an inverted U-shape. \n",
