    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be introduced to **R**. R is a programming language which is particularly well-suited for statistics, econometrics, and data science.  If you are familiar with other programming languages such as Python, this will likely be very familiar. If this is your first time working with a programming language, don't be intimidated!  Try to play around with the examples as you work through this notebook; it's easiest to learn R (or any programming language) by playing around with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "R is an object oriented programming language. This means that we can create many different things (e.g. datasets, matrix, vectors, scalars) within it and they will all be stored in the same environment and accessed the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every new line in R is understood as \n",

    "\n",
    "To begin, it's important to get a good grasp of the different **data types** in R and how to use them.  Whenever we work with R, we will be manipulating different kinds of information referred to as \"data\".  Data comes in many different forms, called _types_, which define how we can use it in calculations or visualizations in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "R has 6 basic data types. Data types are used to store information about a variable or object in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character**: data in text format, like \"word\" or \"abc\"\n",
    "2. **Numeric** (real or decimal): data in real number format, like 6 or 18.8 (referred to as **Double** in R)\n",
    "3. **Integer**: data in whole number (integer) format, like 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)\n",
    "4. **Logical**: truth values, like TRUE or FALSE\n",
    "5. **Complex**: data in complex (i.e. imaginary) format, like 1+6i (where $i$ is the $\\sqrt{-1}$)\n",
    "6. **Raw**: raw digital data, which is unusual and which will not be covered in this section\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are ever wondering what kind of type an object in R has, or what its properties are, we can use the following two functions that allow us to examine the data type and elements contained within an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `typeof()`: this function returns a character string that corresponds to the data type of an object \n",

An object will always have an associated type, determined by the information assigned to it.
