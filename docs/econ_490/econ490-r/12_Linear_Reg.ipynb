The biggest mistake that students make at this stage is not how they run the regression analysis, it is failing to spend enough time preparing data for analysis. \n",
    "- A variable that is qualitative and not ranked cannot be used in an OLS regression without first creating a dummy variable(or a series of dummy variables). Examples of variables that must always be included as dummy variables are sex, race, religiosity, immigration status, and marital status. Examples of variables that are sometimes included as dummy variables are education, income and age. \n",
    "- You will want to take a good look to see how your variables are coded before you begin run regressions and interpreting the results. Make sure that missing values are coded a \".\" and not some value (such as \"99\"). Also, check that qualitative ranked variables are coded in the way you expect (e.g. higher education is coded with a larger number). If you do not do this you could be misinterpreting your results.\n",
    "- Some samples are not proper representations of the population and must be weighted accordingly (we will deal with this in depth later).\n",
    "- You should always think about the theoretical relationship between your variables before you start your regression analysis: Does economic theory predict a linear relationship? Independence between explanatory terms, or is there possibly an interaction?\n"

    "An econometric model describes an equation (or set of equations) that impose some structure on how the data was generated. The most natural way to describe statistical information is the mean.

For example, the population of Indigenous identity in Canada accounts for approximately 5% of the total population.

This would be extremely unethical, and Stats Canada works hard to make sure that data remains anonymized. \n",

    "In this module we distinguished the following concepts: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Model : an equation that describes how the outcome is generated, and depends on some coefficients $\\beta$. \n",
    "- Ordinary Least Squares: a method to obtain a good approximation of the true $\\beta$ of a linear model from a given sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, notice that there is no such thing as OLS model. Notice that we could apply a different method (estimator) to a linear model. For example, consider minimizing the sum of all error terms $$\n",
    "\\min_{b} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i}^n | \\hat{u}_j |\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This model is linear but the solution to this problem are not OLS estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned how to interpret coefficients in any linear model. $\\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the line therefore its equal to $$\n",
    "E[y_{i}|x_{i}=0]=\\beta_0.\n",
    "$$ Its the expected value of y when x=0. Because we have a sample approximation to this true value, it would be the sample mean of y when x=0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of any other beta, $\\beta_1$ or 2 or 3, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "E[y_{i}|x_{i}=1]- E[y_{i}|x_{i}=0]= \\beta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is going to be the difference between the expected value of y due to a change in x. Therefore, each $\\beta$ value tells us the effect that a particular covariate has on y, ceteris paribus. Transformations can also be applied to the variables in question, scaling the interpretation of this $\\beta$ coefficient. Overall, these coefficient estimates are values of great importance when we are developing our research!"
