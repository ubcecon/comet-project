    "In this notebook, we have covered the basic process of working with data. Specifically, we looked at how to load in data, how to view it, and how to clean it by factorizing, dropping and selecting variables and observations. This general scheme is critical to any research project, so it is important to keep in mind as you progress throughout your undergraduate economics coursework and beyond. In the next section, we will cover a larger concept which is also essential to the cleaning of a data set, but merits its own section: creating variables.\n",
