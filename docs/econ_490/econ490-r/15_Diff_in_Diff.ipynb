    "\n",
    "Difference-in-differences (Diff-in-Diff) is a **research design** used to estimate the causal impact of a treatment by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a treated group and an untreated or control group. By comparing changes in outcomes over time, it relies on the use of multiple (at least two) time periods. Therefore, there is a link between Diff-in-Diff designs and panel data. Every time you want to use a Diff-in-Diff design, you always have to make sure you have panel data.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{it} = e_{it} + \\alpha_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_i$ is a measure of worker quality and $e_{it}$ are the part of earnings not explained by $\\alpha_i$. This says that a bad quality worker (low $\\alpha_i$) will receive lower earnings *at any time period*. Notice that worker quality is typically unobserved and is usually part of our error term, which should not be correlated with treatment. In many cases, this invariant heterogeneity is the cause of endogeneity bias. In this example, it can be that workers who attend a training program also tend to be the ones that perform poorly at their job and *select* into this program. \n",
