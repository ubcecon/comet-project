We do this when two data sets have identical columns/variables (so that we can stack them vertically) or an equal number of observations (so that we can stick them beside each other horizontally).\n",
    "2. When we want to add new variables and their data from another data set into our existing data set, we call this **merging** data.\n",
    "    * This is like looking up values in a table and then adding a column; in Excel, this is like using `VLOOKUP`. Importantly, we can only merge data sets that share a common column or key to identify observations with particular values. For example, if we want to merge in data from a different year but for the same people (observations) as those we are currently working with, data sets will usually have an identifying number for the person that functions as our key when merging. Unlike with appending, this does not require column names or numbers of observations to be identical."

Since the unique identifiers common to both data sets are _year_ and _region_, we will use these as our keys within the join functions.
