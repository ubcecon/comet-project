    "When interpreting the coefficients in the regression above, our intercept is again the mean log earnings among those for which all dummies in the regression are 0; here, that is the mean earnings for all people in region 3. Each individual coefficient gives the difference in average log earnings among people in that region and in region 3. For instance, the mean log earnings in region 1 are about 0.012 higher than in region 3, and the mean log earnings in region 2 are about 0.017 lower than in region 3. Both of these differences are statistically significant at a high level (> 99%).\n",

    "It follows from this logic of interpretation that we can compare mean earnings among non-reference groups. For example, the meaning log earnings in region 3 are given by the intercept coefficient: about 10.49. Since the mean log earnings in region 1 are about 0.012 higher than this, they must be about 10.49 + 0.012 = 10.502. In region 2, the mean log earnings are similarly about 10.49 - 0.017 = 10.473. We can thus conclude that the mean log earnings in region 1 are about 10.502 - 10.473 = 0.029 higher than in region 2. In this way, we compared the levels of the dependent variable for 2 dummy variables, neither of which are in the reference group excluded from the regression. One could imagine that we could have much more quickly compared the levels of these groups by comparing their deviations from the base group. Region 1 has mean log earnings about 0.012 above a reference level, while region 2 has mean log earnings about 0.017 below this same reference level; thus, region 1 should have mean log earnings about 0.012 - (-0.017) = 0.029 above region 2."

    "It is an established fact that a wage gap exists between male and female workers. However, it is possible that the wage gap changes depending on the age of the workers. For example, female and male high school students tend to work minimum wage jobs, hence we might believe that the wage gap between people within the 15-18 age bracket is very small. Conversely, once people have the experience to start looking for better paying jobs, we might believe the wage gap starts to increase, meaning that this gap might be much larger in higher age brackets. This means that the wage gap between males and females may also vary as age increases. The way to capture that differential effect of age across males and females is to create a new variable that is the product of the female dummy and age. \n",

    "Whenever we do this it is *very important* that we also include both the female dummy and age as control variables.

We can also see that each additional year of age increases log-earnings by about 0.013 for the reference category (males). This affect of age on log-earnings is lower for females by 0.007, meaning that an extra year of age increase log earnings for women by about 0.013 + (-0.007) = 0.006. It thus seems that our theory is correct: the wage gap between males and females of the same age increases as they get older. For men and women who are both 20, an extra year will be associated with the man earning a bit more than the woman on average. However, if the man and woman are both 50, an extra year will be associated with the man earning much more than the women on average (or at least out-earning her by much more than before).

    "There are very few empirical research projects using micro data that do not require researchers to use dummy variables. Important qualitative measures such as marital status, immigration status, occupation, industry, and race always require that we use dummy variables. Other important variables such as education, income, age and number of children often require us to use dummy variables, even when they are measured using ranked categorical variables. For example, we could have a variable that measures years of education as a continuous variable. However, we might instead want to include a variable that indicated if the person has a university degree. If that is the case we can use `as.factor()` to create a dummy variable indicating that level of education. \n",

For example, we might have a data set that measures macro variables for African countries, including information about historic colonization. We might want to create dummy variables that indicate the origin of the colonizers, and then include that in our analysis to understand that effect. As another example, we might have a time series data set and want to indicate whether or not a specific policy was implemented in any one time period. We will need a dummy variable for that, and can include one in our analysis using the same process described above. Finally, we can use interaction terms to capture the effect of one variable on another if we believe that it varies between groups. If the coefficient on this interaction term is statistically significant, it is justified that this term be included in our regression for analysis.
