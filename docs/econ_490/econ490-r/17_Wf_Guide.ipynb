You might (legitimately!!) be concerned that all of your hard work will be lost if your computer is damaged or stolen.

These are all detailed scripts which accomplish very different goals. To combine them all into a single script could be quite overwhelming. With a master script, however, you can run all of these scripts quickly while leaving them discretely separated in various files. In this way, the master script is like a compiler.\n",

While copying file paths is not a problem for Mac users (since R can read forward slashes just fine), the backslashes inherent to file paths for Windows users are a problem. For Windows users, one can either change all of the backslashes to forward slashes (as has been done throughout this notebook), or simply add a second backslash to all existing backslashes.

    "## 17.4 Best Practices for Writing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three core practices that will make it easy to write, edit and understand your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding comments\n",
    "2. Splitting up your code into multiple lines\n",
    "3. Indenting and spacing your code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 17.4.1 Commenting\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving comments will not only help you remember what you have done, but it will help your group members, your TA and your instructor understand your process. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to comment in an R script\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# comments on individual lines\n",
    "\n",
    "1 + 1 # comments on individual lines and after some code\n",
    "\n",
    "# comments on multiple lines\n",
    "# like a \"code block\"\n",
    "# activated by highlighting your code and running CTRL + shift + C (or Command + shift + C on mac)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a series of number signs `#` or combination of number signs and dashes `#-` to format your script and partition your code. For instance, for a script dedicated to data cleaning, we can specify its purpose at the top as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "####################\n",
    "# Data Cleaning\n",
    "#------------------#\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting your script in this manner creates visual bookmarks and highlights different sections of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use for comments is to \"comment out\" code that you might be testing or might need later. Use a number sign to comment out a line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# fake_data <- data %>% mutate(log_earnings = log(earnings))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment out a block of code by running CTRL + shift + C on Windows or Command + shift + C on mac. There is no formal way of commenting out a block of code in writing like in Stata, so this command is the best approach to quickly comment out a block of code if you don't want to run it right now but feel you may need it later:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "\n",
    "# fake_data %>% group_by(region) %>% count()\n",
    "# fake_data %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(meanearnings = mean(earnings))\n",
    "# fake_data %>% group_by(region) %>% summarise(total = n())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, leave comments before or after your code to explain what you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Open Raw Data\n",
    "fake_data <- read.csv(\"1. data/fake_data.csv\")\n",
    "\n",
    "fake_data <- as.factor(fake_data) # factorize all variables\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move on to writing more complex code, leaving comments will become more helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 17.4.2 Splitting the code across lines\n",
    "\n",
    "R can automatically read code as continuing across multiple lines, provided we don't give it a reason to believe our code is finished. Let's look at an example to see why.\n",
    "Imagine we want to create a scatterplot in R combining the command `ggplot` and `geom_point` (for all details on how to do graphs in R, see [Module 9](econometrics/econ490-r/9_ggplot_graphs.ipynb)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The line of code that achieves it is `figure <- ggplot(data = fake_data, aes(x = year,  y = earnings)) + geom_point()`.\n",
    "This may be too long and we may want to split it in several lines. Knowing that R can read code as continuing across multiple lines, we would be tempted to write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "figure <- ggplot(data = fake_data, aes(x = year,  y = earnings))\n",
    "+ geom_point()\n",
    "\n",
    "figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "R will return an error for the above code. This is because it believes our code is done on the first line, so that the addition of `geom_point` is alone and non-sensical. For R to understand that `ggplot` and `geom_point` belong to the same block of code, we must leave the plus sign on the first line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "figure <- ggplot(data = fake_data, aes(x = year,  y = earnings)) + \n",
    "geom_point()\n",
    "\n",
    "figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The plus sign at the end of the first line signals to R that the code on the first line is not complete and it must keep reading down below to `geom_point`. While operators allow R to \"keep reading\" across multiple lines, an open bracket achieves the same goal. For example, we could split the code in two lines such that `aes(` is the last word on the first line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "figure <- ggplot(data = fake_data, aes(\n",
    "                     x = year, y = earnings)) + geom_point()\n",
    "                 \n",
    "figure\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our code is split across multiple lines and is also easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 17.4.3 Indenting and spacing your code\n",
    "\n",
    "Using indentations in your code and spacing it neatly can further improve its readability with little effort. You can use the `tab` button on your keyboard to indent and organize your code. Let's reformat the last example to see this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "figure <- ggplot(data = fake_data,\n",
    "                 aes(\n",
    "                     x = year,  \n",
    "                     y = earnings) + \n",
    "          geom_point()\n",
    "\n",
    "figure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same code block as before, but it is significantly easier to read this time around.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not want to indent your code on such a granular level, as shown in the example above. That's okay, as long as the code is organized in a way that is clear to you and your collaborators, and generally easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 17.4.4 Putting it all together \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review a final example that combines all the code styling tools we have discussed so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "figure <- ggplot(data = fake_data, # choose the data we want\n",
    "                 aes(\n",
    "                     x = year,  # x is year\n",
    "                     y = average_logearn) # y is earnings\n",
    "          + geom_point()\n",
    "                 \n",
    "\n",
    "figure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The comments in this example might seem unnecessary, since the code is self-explanatory. However, depending on your familiarity with R (or coding in general) and the complexity of the code, adding comments that seem obvious at the time can be helpful when you revisit your work days or weeks later. As students of economics, we understand that there is an opportunity cost to everything, including time spent deciphering code already written."
