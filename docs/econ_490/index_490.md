* There are **two versions** of these notebooks: one for STATA and one for R.
  - The STATA version _must_ be installed manually in order for the notebooks to run; this can be done by following the instructions regarding the STATA kernel
  - The R version can be run locally or via a JupyterHub
* These modules are intended primarily for either classroom or lab instructions; they can also be self-studied with relative ease.
* There also also videos to support the STATA modules
