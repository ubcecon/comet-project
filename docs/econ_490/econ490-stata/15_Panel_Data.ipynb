    "## 15.1 What is Panel Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "In economics, we typically have data consisting of many units observed at a particular point in time. This is called cross-sectional data. There may be several different versions of the data set that are collected over time (monthly, annually, etc.), but each version includes an entirely different set of individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a Canadian cross-sectional data set: General Social Survey Cycle 31: Family, 2017. In this data set, the first observation is a 55 year old married woman who lives in Alberta with two children. When the General Social Survey Cycle 25: Family, 2011 was collected six years previously there were probably similar women surveyed, but it is extremely unlikely that this exact same woman was included in that data set as well. Even if she was included, we would have no way to match her data over the two years of the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-sectional data allows us to explore variation between individuals at one point in time but does not allow us to explore variation over time for those same individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are also familiar with time-series data sets from your previous economics courses. Time-series data sets contain observations over several years for only one country, state, province, etc. For example, measures of income, output, unemployment, and fertility for Canada from 1960 to 2020 would be considered time-series data. Time-series data allows us to explore variation over time for one individual unit (e.g. Canada), but does not allow us to explore variation between individual units (i.e. multiple countries) at any one point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel data allows us to observe the same unit across multiple time periods. For example, the [Penn World Tables](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en) is a panel data set that measures income, output, input and productivity, covering 183 countries from 1950 to the near present. There are also microdata panel data sets that follow the same people over time. One example is the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), which followed the same children from 1994 to 2010, surveying them every two years as they progressed from childhood to adulthood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Panel data sets allow us to answer questions that we cannot answer with time series and cross-sectional data; they allow us to simultaneously explore variation over time for individual countries (for example) and variation between individuals at one point in time. This approach is extremely productive for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Panel data sets are large, much larger than if we were to use data collected at one point in time.\n",
    "2. Panel data regressions control for variables that do not change over time and are difficult to measure, such as geography and culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, panel data sets allow us to answer empirical questions that cannot be answered with other types of data such as cross-sectional or time-series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move forward exploring panel data sets in this module, we should understand the two main types of panel data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balanced Panel: A panel data set in which we observe *all* units over *all* included time periods. Suppose we have a data set following the school outcomes of a select group of $N$ children over $T$ years. This is common in studies which investigate the effects of early childhood interventions on relevant outcomes over time. If the panel data set is balanced, we will see $T$ observations for each child corresponding to the $T$ years they have been tracked. As a result, our data set in total will have $n = N*T$ observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unbalanced Panel: A panel data set in which we do _not_ observe all units over all included time periods. Suppose in our data set tracking select children's education outcomes over time that some children drop out of the study. This panel data set would be an unbalanced panel because it would necessarily have $n < N*T$ observations since the children who dropped out would not have observations for the years they were no longer in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned the techniques to create a balanced panel the notebook Within Group Analysis (7). Essentially all that is needed is to create a new data set that includes only the years for which there are no missing values. \n"

    "The coefficients in a panel regression are interpreted similarly to those in a basic OLS regression. Because we have taken the natural log of our variables, we can interpret the coefficient on each explanatory variable as being that a 1% increase in the explanatory variable leads to a $\\beta$ % increase in the dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in the regression results above, a 1% increase in human capital leads to a roughly 2% increase in real GDP per capita. That's a huge effect, but then again this model is almost certainly misspecified due to omitted variable bias. Namely, we are likely missing a number of explanatory variables that explain variation in both GDP per capita and human capital, such as savings and population growth rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we know is that GDP per capita can be impacted by the individual characteristics of a country that do not change much over time. For example, it is known that distance from the equator has an impact on the standard of living of a country; countries that are closer to the equator are generally poorer than those farther from it. This is a time-invariant characteristic that we might want to control for in our regression. At the same time, we know that GDP per capita could be similarly impacted in many countries by a shock at one point in time. For example, a worldwide global recession would affect the GDP per capita of all countries at a given time such that values of GDP per capita in this time period are uniformly different in all countries from values in other periods. That seems like a time-variant characteristic (time trend) that we might want to control for in our regression. Fortunately, with panel data regressions we can account for these sources of endogeneity. Let's look at how panel data helps us do this now."

    "\n",
    "We refer to shocks that are invariant based on some variable (e.g. household level shocks that don't vary with year or time-specific shocks that don't vary with household) as **fixed effects**. For instance, we can define household fixed effects, time fixed effects, and so on. Notice that this is an assumption on the error terms, and as such, when we include fixed effects to our specification they become part of the model we assume to be true. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we ran our regression of log real GDP per capita on log human capital from earlier where we were concerned about omitted variable bias and endogeneity. We are concerned about distance from the equator positively impacting both human capital and real GDP per capita, in which case our measure of human capital would be correlated with our error term, preventing us from interpreting our regression result as causal. We are now able to add country fixed effects to our regression to account for this and come closer to determining the pure effect of human capital on GDP growth. There are two ways to do this. Let's look at the more obvious one first.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Approach 1*: create a series of country dummy variables for each country and include them in the regression. For example, we would have one dummy variable called \"Canada\" that would be equal to 1 if the country is Canada and 0 if not. We would have dummy variables for all but one of the countries in this data set in order to avoid introducing perfect collinearity into our regression specification. Rather than define all of these dummies manually and include them in our `reg` command, we can simply add i.code into our regression. Stata will then manually create all of the code (country) variables for us."

The permanent income shocks are, by definition, very persistent over time. This would mean that $\\varepsilon_{t-1}$ affects (and thus is correlated with) shocks in the next period $\\varepsilon_t$. This problem is called serial correlation or autocorrelation, and if it exists, the assumptions of the regression model (i.e. unbiasedness, consistency, etc.) are violated.

    "## 15.6 How is Panel Data Helpful?\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical cross-sectional settings, it is hard to defend a selection on observables (otherwise known as conditional independence) assumption. However, panel data allows us to control for unobserved time invariant heterogeneity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example. Household income  $y_{jt}$ at time $t$ can be split into two components: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{jt} = e_{jt} + \\Psi_{j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where $\\Psi_{j}$ is a measure of unobserved household-level determinants of income such as social programs targeted towards certain households. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Consider what happens when we compute each $j$ household's average income, average value of $e$, and average value of $\\Psi$ across time $t$ in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{y}_{J}= \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j,t}   \\mathbf{1}\\{ j = J \\}  } \\sum_{j,t}  y_{jt} \\mathbf{1}\\{ j = J \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{e}_{J}= \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j,t}   \\mathbf{1}\\{ j = J \\}  } \\sum_{j,t}  e_{jt} \\mathbf{1}\\{ j = J \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{\\Psi}_{J} =  \\Psi_{J}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that the mean of $\\Psi_{j}$ does not change over time for a fixed household $j$. Hence, we can subtract the two household level means from the original equation to get: \n",
    "   \n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{jt} - \\bar{y}_{j} = e_{jt} - \\bar{e}_{j}  + \\underbrace{ \\Psi_{j} - \\bar{\\Psi}_{j}  }_\\text{equals zero!}\n",

    " \n",
    "Therefore, we are able to get rid of the unobserved heterogeneity in household determinants of income via \"de-meaning\"! This is called a within-group or fixed-effects transform. If we believe these types of unobserved errors/shocks are creating endogeneity, we can get rid of them using this powerful trick. In some cases, we may alternatively choose to do a first-differences transform of our regression specification. This entails subtracting the regression in one period not from its expectation across time but from the regression in the previous period. In this case, time-invariant characteristics are similarly removed from the regression since they are constant across all periods $t$."
