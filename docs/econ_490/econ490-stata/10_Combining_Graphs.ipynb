    "For this example, we want to generate two graphs with the same schema (they are the same type of graph and use the same variables as their x and y axis) and combine them using the `graph combine` command. Let's begin by setting up the data. We are going to first generate a new variable that shows the logarithm of workers' earnings. As explained in previous modules, collapsing data is irreversible; therefore, we can `preserve` the data set before we collapse it. Then, once we don't want to use the collapsed version of the data set anymore, we can `reverse` it back to the original data set we preserved. Therefore,  we are going to preserve our data set and then collapse it by variables `treated` and `year`. This way our data has no two unique ids, `treated` and `year`. "

    "In this module we learned how to use the command `generate combine`. When producing a research paper we might want to compare statistics from different countries or different regions such as GDP, population density, inflation, exports, etc. These types of graphs allow us to see how the same variables diverge between different categories (for example how earnings diverge between region 1 and 2 in ex. 1) and also can show the relationship between different variables throughout one. Understanding what graphs to use and how to portray them is of extreme importance when building a research project, which is why working alongside the `twoway` and `graph combine` documentation is always of great value."
