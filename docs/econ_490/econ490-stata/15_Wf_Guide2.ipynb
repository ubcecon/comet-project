    "As we learned in [Module 4](econometrics/econ490-stata/4_Locals_and_Globals.ipynb), macros store information either temporarily `local` or permanently `global`. Locals store information within a code instance and disappear once the instance ends. Globals are stored in memory until you close Stata, hence they are considered \"permanent\".\n",

    "## 15.4 Best Practices for Writing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three core practices that will make it easy to write, edit and understand your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding comments.\n",
    "2. Splitting up your code into multiple lines.\n",
    "3. Indenting and spacing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15.4.1 Commenting\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving comments will not only help you remember what you have done, but it will help your group members, your TA and your instructor understand your thought process. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to comment in a Stata do-file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "* comments on individual lines\n",
    "\n",
    "// comments on individual lines and after some code\n",
    "\n",
    "/*\n",
    "comments on multiple lines\n",
    "like a \"code block\"\n",
    "*/\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a series of asterisks `*` to format your do file and partition your code. In the `0_master.do` example we saw earlier, the directory settings were highlighted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "********************\n",
    "* Directory Settings\n",
    "********************\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting your do-file in this manner creates visual bookmarks and highlights different sections of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use for comments is to \"comment out\" code that you might be testing or might need later. Use an asterisk to comment out a line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "*gen log_earnings = log(earnings)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or comment out a block of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "/*\n",
    "label variable workerid \"ID\"\n",
    "la var treated \"Treatment Dummy\"\n",
    "la var earnings \"Earnings\"\n",
    "la var year \"Calendar Year\"\n",
    "*/\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, leave comments before or after your code to explain what you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "* Open Raw Data\n",
    "import delimit using \"${datadir}/raw/fake_data.csv\", clear\n",
    "\n",
    "la var birth_year \"Year of Birth\" // label variable\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move on to writing more complex code, leaving comments will become more helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15.4.2 Splitting the code across lines\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stata, we can split code across multiple lines using three forward slashes `///`. This can be particularly useful when making graphs. Let's see an example to understand why.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway (connected log_earnings year if treated) || (connected log_earnings if !treated), ylabel(#8) xlabel(#10) ytitle(\"Log-earnings\") xtitle(\"Year\") legend( label(1 \"Treated\") label(2 \"Control\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Making a graph has a lot of small components, all clustered together in a single line of code. If we had to go back and change the number of ticks for the x-axis `xlabel(#)`, it is safe to say it might take us a moment to parse through all this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's format this code block using `///` to split it across multiple lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if treated) || (connected log_earnings year if !treated) , ///\n",
    "    ylabel(#8)  xlabel(#10) ///\n",
    "    ytitle(\"Log-earnings\") xtitle(\"Year\") ///\n",
    "    legend( label(1 \"Treated\") label(2 \"Control\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it easier for you to find `xlabel(#)` this time around?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `///` is a simple step we can take to make code blocks appear neat and legible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15.4.3 Indent and space your code\n",
    "\n",
    "Using indentations in your code and spacing it neatly can improve its readability with little effort. You can use the `tab` button on your keyboard to indent and organize your code. Let's reformat the last example to see this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway                                              ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if treated)        ///\n",

As students of economics, we understand that there is an opportunity cost to everything, including time spent deciphering code we have already written."

    "## 15.5 More on Project Settings (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above you have been advised to include project settings in your master do-file to give you more control over what do-files are run and what log-files are created (although this is not absolutely necessary for your ECON 490 project). This section will give you more information on how those settings are used. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15.5.1 `run` settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider how we might now run our do-files in the master do-file if we are using the `run` settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "******************\n",
    "* Run the do-files\n",
    "******************\n",
    "\n",
    "if ${run_build}==1{\n",
    "\tdo \"${do_dir}/1_build_data.do\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if ${run_descriptive}==1{\n",
    "\tdo \"${do_dir}/2_descriptive.do\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if ${run_mainresults}==1{\n",
    "\tdo \"${do_dir}/3_results.do\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is almost the same as the code block we saw earlier to run all our do-files. The key difference is that each command is nested within an `[if]` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `[if]` statements correspond to the global settings: IF the statement `${some_global}==1` is TRUE, THEN run the command in the curly brackets, which is `do \"filename\"`. Can you guess what happens if the statement is FALSE?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one missing piece in this story. The comments in the settings say that assigning a value of `0` to a global skips that action. You may have noticed, however, that the `[if]` statement would return as FALSE for any value of `global run_build` as long as it is not equal to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could set `global run_build = 8` and Stata would still return the statement `${run_build}==1` as FALSE. The question remains: when does `0` become relevant?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, we have to think of our master do-file as a very long script that links all the other do-files together. Let's consider a scenario where we want to skip the build step. This means our script begins with `2_descriptive.do`; however, `2_descriptive.do` includes commands to work with the data set we opened in `1_build_data.do`. Note that we don't open the data set in the beginning of each do-file over and over again. This means we need to add a condition in the beginning of the `2_descriptive.do` script where we open the correct data set in the event we skip the first step. \n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "if ${run_build}==0 {\n",
    "\tuse \"${datadir}/final/main_data.dta\", clear\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This clearly defines a situation where, if we skip the build data step, then we load the correct data set in Stata to run `2_descriptive.do` .\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we were to skip the first two steps, then we would have to load the correct data set to run the results (i.e. step 3). We include the following command in the beginning of `3_results.do` to address this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "if ${run_build}==0 & ${run_descriptive}==0 {\n",
    "\tuse \"${datadir}/final/main_data.dta\", clear\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed, all scenarios where we skip a step are associated with `if ${some_global}==0`. As a result, we limit the values assigned to the global settings to 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15.5.2 `store_log` settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a look at the `store_log` settings, which help us automate the process of storing log-files. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the do-files except `0_master.do` include the `log` command in the beginning and end of the file. The `log` command is nested within an `[if]` statement related to the global settings, exactly like we saw earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "*If log setting is activated, we record a log file in the log folder\n",
    "if ${store_log_descriptive}==1 {\n",
    "\tcap log close\n",
    "\tlog using \"${log_dir}/2_descriptive.log\", replace\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    ".\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "*Close log if needed\n",
    "if ${store_log_descriptive}==1 {\n",
    "\tcap log close\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we start with an `[if]` statement which makes our global settings viable. Within the curly brackets we include `cap log close` to ensure that any open log-files from prior attempts are closed before we open the log-file. Then we use `log using \"${log_dir}/2_descriptive.log\", replace` which generates a log-file stored in the log directory `log_dir` (we defined this in the master file) and saves it under the name `2_descriptive.log`. Finally, at the end of the script we include a command to close the log-file. \n",
    "\n",
    "We include this code within each of the do-files, only changing the `store_log` global and the name of the log-file to match the appropriate step. "
