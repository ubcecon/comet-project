    "## 8.1 Introduction to Merge and Append\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when we are working with data sets it is necessary to merge or append existing data with other data sets. For example, imagine that we want to do one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to run a regression that has the number of births as the main dependent variable and education level of the mother as an explanatory variable. We have two such micro data sets, one from Canada and one from the US, and we want to combine them into one data set that includes observations from both countries. To do our research, we need to take one data set (say, the Canadian data) and append to it the second data set (here, the US data). This final data set will have same number of variables as the initial data set(s), but the number of observations will be the number of observations in the Canadian data set plus the number of observations in the US data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to run a regression that has the national fertility rate as the main dependent variable and GDP/capita as an explanatory variable. We have one macro data set that has three variables - country, year, and fertility rate - and a second macro data set also with three variables - country, year, and GDP/capita. To do our research, we need to merge these two data sets to create a final data set. That final data set will have the same number of observations as the initial data set(s), but now with four variables: country, year, fertility rate and GDP/capita. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to undertake these two approaches to combining data sets: using merge and append. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll continue working with our fake data. Recall that this data set is simulating information of workers in the years 1982-2012 in a fake country where a training program was introduced in 2003 to boost their earnings. "
