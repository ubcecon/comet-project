    "Before we get started on importing data into Stata, it is useful to know how to change the folder that Stata accesses whenever we run a command that either opens or saves a file. Once we instruct Stata to change the directory to a specific folder, from that point onward it will open files from that folder and save all files to that folder, including data files, do files, and log files. Stata will continue to do this until either the program is closed or we change to another directory.
