    "- A variable that is qualitative and not ranked cannot be used in an OLS regression without first creating a dummy variable(or a series of dummy variables). Examples of variables that must always be included as dummy variables are sex, race, religiosity, immigration status, and marital status. Examples of variables that are sometimes included as dummy variables are education, income and age. \n",
    "- You will want to take a good look to see how your variables are coded before you begin running regressions and interpreting the results. Make sure that missing values are coded as \".\" and not some value (such as \"99\"). Also, check that qualitative ranked variables are coded in the way you expect (e.g. higher education is coded with a larger number). If you do not do this, you could misinterpret your results.\n",
    "- Some samples are not proper representations of the population and must be weighted accordingly (we will deal with this in depth later).\n",

    "An econometric model describes an equation (or set of equations) that impose some structure on how the data was generated. The most natural way to describe statistical information is the mean. Therefore, we typically model the mean of a (dependent) variable and how it can depend on different factors (independent variables or covariates). The easiest way to describe a relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, x is linearly. \n",

Fortunately, we can use these in a formula (also known as an estimator!) to obtain a reasonable guess of the true $\\beta$s.

Magnitude is always important when seeing whether a relationship, even if it statistically significant and thus we can be quite sure it's not 0, is actually large in size (whether positive or negative). Understanding whether the magnitude of a coefficient is economically meaningful typically requires a firm understanding of the economic literature in that area."

    "\n",
    "Notice that OLS gives us a linear approximation to the conditional mean of some dependent variable, given some observables. We can use this information for prediction: if we had different observables, how would the expected mean differ? Another thing we can do with OLS is discuss causality: how does manipulating one variable impact a dependent variable on average?\n",

    "To give a causal interpretation to our OLS estimates, we require that in the population it holds that \n",
    "$\\mathbf{E}[X_i u_i] = 0$, the unobservables are uncorrelated with the independent variables of the equation (remember, this is not testable because we cannot compute the expectations in practice!). If these unobservables are correlated with an independent variable, this means the independent variable can be causing a change in the dependent variable because of a change in an unobservable rather than a change in the independent variable itself. This inhibits our ability to interpret our coefficients with causality and is known as the endogeneity problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be tempted to think that we can test this using the sample version $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j}^n  X_i u_i = 0$, but notice  from the first order conditions that this is true by construction! It is by design a circular argument; we are assuming that it holds true when we compute the solution to OLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, looking at the previous regression, if we want to say that the causal effect of being treated is equal to -0.81, it must be the case that treatment is not correlated (in the population sense) with the error term. However, it could be the case that treated workers are the ones that usually perform worse at their job, which would belie a causal interpretation of our OLS estimates. This brings us to a short discussion of what distinguishes good and bad controls in a regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good Controls: To think about good controls, we need to consider which *unobserved* determinants of the outcome are possibly correlated with our variable of interest.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Bad Controls: It is bad practice to include variables that are themselves outcomes. For instance, consider studying the causal effect of college on earnings. If we include a covariate of working at a high paying job, then we're blocking part of the causal channel between college and earnings (i.e. you are more likely to have a nice job if you study more years!)"
