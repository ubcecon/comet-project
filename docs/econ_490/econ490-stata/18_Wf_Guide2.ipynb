    "Over the course of the research project, you are likely to accumulate numerous files for our project, including raw data files, do-files, tables, graphs and figures. In fact, there are often many versions of each of these files. You should start by creating a main folder or a \"root\" folder where _all_ your project files and folders are organized. If you are working with other people, consider creating these folders on a shared drive such as [UBC Microsoft One Drive](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/microsoft-onedrive-student-guide/). More on this in a moment.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's almost never a good idea to use one do-file for your entire project. Instead, create different do-files for different tasks and add descriptive labels to reflect your workflow. As mentioned in the previous section, prefix your files with numbers to align with the workflow sequence.\n",

Version numbers can be `_v1`, `_v2` (i.e. \"ECON490_logfile_v12.txt\") or they can be indicated by dates (i.e. \"ECON490_logfile_230430.txt\"). \n",

    "Above, we indicated that our Master do-file will contain **directory settings**. Here is an example of what those should look like. These lines should be included in your master do file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two essential tools utilized in this master file:\n",
    "1. Relative file paths\n",
    "2. Macros (i.e. locals and globals)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned in [Module 4](econometrics/econ490-stata/4_Locals_and_Globals.ipynb), macros store information either temporarily with `local` objects or permanently with `global` objects. Locals store information within a code instance and disappear once the instance ends. Globals are stored in memory until you close Stata, hence they are considered \"permanent\".\n",

Note that we don't need to specify the full file path for each sub-directory, as it would be already included in the main folder. For example, for the data folder, we can simply use `${proj_main}/data`. \n",
    "\n",

    "## 18.4 Best Practices for Writing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three core practices that will make it easy to write, edit and understand your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding comments.\n",
    "2. Splitting up your code into multiple lines.\n",
    "3. Indenting and spacing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.4.1 Commenting\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving comments will not only help you remember what you have done, but it will help your group members, your TA and your instructor understand your thought process. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to comment in a Stata do-file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "* comments on individual lines\n",
    "\n",
    "// comments on individual lines and after some code\n",
    "\n",
    "/*\n",
    "comments on multiple lines\n",
    "like a \"code block\"\n",
    "*/\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a series of asterisks `*` to format your do file and partition your code. In the `0_master.do` example we saw earlier, the directory settings were highlighted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "********************\n",
    "* Directory Settings\n",
    "********************\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting your do-file in this manner creates visual bookmarks and highlights different sections of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use for comments is to \"comment out\" code that you might be testing or might need later. Use an asterisk to comment out a line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "*gen log_earnings = log(earnings)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or comment out a block of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "/*\n",
    "label variable workerid \"ID\"\n",
    "la var treated \"Treatment Dummy\"\n",
    "la var earnings \"Earnings\"\n",
    "la var year \"Calendar Year\"\n",
    "*/\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, leave comments before or after your code to explain what you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "* Open Raw Data\n",
    "import delimit using \"${datadir}/raw/fake_data.csv\", clear\n",
    "\n",
    "la var birth_year \"Year of Birth\" // label variable\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move on to writing more complex code, leaving comments will become more helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.4.2 Splitting the code across lines\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stata, we can split code across multiple lines using three forward slashes `///`. This can be particularly useful when making graphs. Let's see an example to understand why. Imagine we want to create a graph overlaying information for treated workers and untreated workers, such that they are marked with two different colors (we will see in details how to do this in [Module 9](econometrics/econ490-stata/9_Stata_Graphs.ipynb)). The line of code to do it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway (connected log_earnings year if treated) || (connected log_earnings if !treated), ylabel(#8) xlabel(#10) ytitle(\"Log-earnings\") xtitle(\"Year\") legend( label(1 \"Treated\") label(2 \"Control\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Making a graph has a lot of small components, all clustered together in a single line of code. If we had to go back and change the number of ticks for the x-axis `xlabel(#)`, it is safe to say it might take us a moment to parse through all this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's format this code block using `///` to split it across multiple lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if treated) || (connected log_earnings year if !treated) , ///\n",
    "    ylabel(#8)  xlabel(#10) ///\n",
    "    ytitle(\"Log-earnings\") xtitle(\"Year\") ///\n",
    "    legend( label(1 \"Treated\") label(2 \"Control\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it easier for you to find `xlabel(#)` this time around?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `///` is a simple step we can take to make code blocks appear neat and legible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.4.3 Indent and space your code\n",
    "\n",
    "Using indentations in your code and spacing it neatly can improve its readability with little effort. You can use the `tab` button on your keyboard to indent and organize your code. Let's reformat the last example to see this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "twoway                                              ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if treated)        ///\n",
    "    ||                                              ///\n",
    "    (connected log_earnings year if !treated)       ///\n",
    "        ,                                           ///\n",
    "        ylabel(#8)                                  ///\n",
    "        xlabel(#10)                                 ///\n",
    "        ytitle(\"Log-earnings\")                      ///\n",
    "        xtitle(\"Year\")                              ///\n",
    "        legend(                                     ///\n",
    "            label(1 \"Treated\")                      ///\n",
    "            label(2 \"Control\")                      ///\n",
    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same code block as before, but it is significantly easier to read this time around. Try to find `xlabel(#)` once again. Do you notice any difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not want to indent your code on such a granular level as shown in the example above. That's okay, as long as the code is organized in a way that is clear to you and your collaborators and is generally easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.4.4 Putting it all together \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review a final example which combines all the code styling tools we have discussed so far:\n",

    "The comments in this example might seem unnecessary since the code is self-explanatory. However, depending on your familiarity with Stata (or coding in general) and the complexity of the code, adding comments that seem obvious at the time can be helpful when you revisit your work days or weeks later. As students of economics, we understand that there is an opportunity cost to everything, including time spent deciphering code we have already written."

    "## 18.5 More on Project Settings (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our workflow can be simplified by defining project settings in the master do-file that determine which do-files are run and whether or not log files are generated. You can think of project settings as a series of switches that you can switch on and off in your work. For example, you could turn the switch to \"off\" for the do-file that builds the data when the data has already been fully processed and saved in your folder, or you could the switch to \"on\" to create a log file when you want to keep a record of the run of the do-file. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to include project settings in your master do-file, you will need to include specific lines of codes in the project settings and in the *run* settings of the master do-file, as well as in the *store_log* settings of specific do-files. We will see each of the three components below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.5.1 Project settings\n",
    "\n",
    "For each step of the process settings, we will create globals to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run globals that will switch on and off the running of the do-file (`run_build`, `run_descriptive`, `run_mainresults`)\n",
    "2. Store globals that will switch on and off the creation of the log-file (`store_log_build`, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "These process settings will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "*******************\n",
    "* Project Settings:\n",
    "*******************\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Build intermediate and final data set from raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "global run_build = 1                // 0 = skip build step; 1 = run build.do\n",
    "global store_log_build = 1          // 0 = don't save log file; 1 = save log file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Run descriptive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "global run_descriptive = 1          // 0 = skip; 1 = run\n",
    "global store_log_descriptive = 1    // 0 = don't save log file; 1 = save log file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Run main results (e.g. regressions)\n",
    "\n",
    "global run_mainresults = 1          // 0 = skip; 1 = run\n",
    "global store_log_mainresults = 1    // 0 = don't save log file; 1 = save log file\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, our settings don't mean much; we have simply created globals and assigned them a specific value. When we reference these globals in our master do-file and in other do files, these settings will become meaningful. The values you choose to assign these globals will determine which actions occur and which don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "`run` settings are referenced in two cases:\n",
    "1. In the master do-file under the \"run project\" section.\n",
    "2. In the beginning of the project do files, when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "`store_log` settings are referenced in two cases:\n",
    "1. Always at the beginning of the project do-files (excluding the master do-file).\n",
    "2. Always at the end of the project do-files (excluding the master do-file).\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be discussed in more detail below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.5.2 *run* settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider how we might now run our do-files in the master do-file if we are using the `run` settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "******************\n",
    "* Run the do-files\n",
    "******************\n",
    "\n",
    "if ${run_build}==1{\n",
    "\tdo \"${do_dir}/1_build_data.do\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if ${run_descriptive}==1{\n",
    "\tdo \"${do_dir}/2_descriptive.do\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if ${run_mainresults}==1{\n",
    "\tdo \"${do_dir}/3_results.do\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is almost the same as the code block we saw earlier to run all our do-files. The key difference is that each command is nested within an `[if]` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `[if]` statements correspond to the global settings: IF the statement `${some_global}==1` is TRUE, THEN run the command in the curly brackets, which is `do \"filename\"`. Can you guess what happens if the statement is FALSE?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one missing piece in this story. The comments in the settings say that assigning a value of `0` to a global skips that action. You may have noticed, however, that the `[if]` statement would return as FALSE for any value of `global run_build` as long as it is not equal to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could set `global run_build = 8` and Stata would still return the statement `${run_build}==1` as FALSE. The question remains: when does `0` become relevant?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, we have to think of our master do-file as a very long script that links all the other do-files together. Let's consider a scenario where we want to skip the build step. This means our script begins with `2_descriptive.do`; however, `2_descriptive.do` includes commands to work with the data set we opened in `1_build_data.do`. Note that we don't open the data set in the beginning of each do-file over and over again. This means we need to add a condition in the beginning of the `2_descriptive.do` script where we open the correct data set in the event we skip the first step. \n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "if ${run_build}==0 {\n",
    "\tuse \"${datadir}/final/main_data.dta\", clear\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This clearly defines a situation where, if we skip the build data step, then we load the correct data set in Stata to run `2_descriptive.do` .\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we were to skip the first two steps, then we would have to load the correct data set to run the results (i.e. step 3). We include the following command in the beginning of `3_results.do` to address this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "if ${run_build}==0 & ${run_descriptive}==0 {\n",
    "\tuse \"${datadir}/final/main_data.dta\", clear\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed, all scenarios where we skip a step are associated with `if ${some_global}==0`. As a result, we limit the values assigned to the global settings to 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18.5.3 *store_log* settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a look at the `store_log` settings, which help us automate the process of storing log-files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that all do-files except `0_master.do` include the `log` command in the beginning and end of the file. The `log` command is nested within an `[if]` statement related to the global settings, exactly like we saw earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "*If log setting is activated, we record a log file in the log folder\n",
    "if ${store_log_descriptive}==1 {\n",
    "\tcap log close\n",
    "\tlog using \"${log_dir}/2_descriptive.log\", replace\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    ".\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "*Close log if needed\n",
    "if ${store_log_descriptive}==1 {\n",
    "\tcap log close\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we start with an `[if]` statement which makes our global settings viable. Within the curly brackets we include `cap log close` to ensure that any open log-files from prior attempts are closed before we open the log-file. Then we use `log using \"${log_dir}/2_descriptive.log\", replace` which generates a log-file stored in the log directory `log_dir` (we defined this in the master file) and saves it under the name `2_descriptive.log`. Finally, at the end of the script we include a command to close the log-file. \n",
    "\n",
    "We include this code within each of the do-files, only changing the `store_log` global and the name of the log-file to match the appropriate step. "
