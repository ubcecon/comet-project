    "## 2.1 Introduction to Do-Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Do-files record the list of commands we want to run for our analysis and allow us to run these commands directly from the file. When we run our analysis in a do-file, we always know exactly what we have asked Stata to compute, which leads to far fewer errors. We can also easily edit the file whenever we want to make any changes to our analysis. Further, we will often want to repeat the same analysis over and over again (say for subgroups of our sample). Using a do-file makes this straightforward. Finally, and importantly for ECON 490, you can show your do-file to either your TA or your instructor for help and feedback. Many sections of ECON 490 require students to submit their do-files with their final paper. \n",

    "Log-files save a recording of everything that appears in the results window when you run your do-file. Your instructor and TA will want to see your log-file whenever you have problems with your analysis and, as with the do-file, most instructors will require students to submit their log-files with their final research at the end of the term.  \n",

    "It is important to get into the practice of creating a log-file every time you run a do-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start every do-file with the command initiating the creation of a log. The command `log` tells Stata to open a log-file and create a record of what you type and any output that appears in the Results window. The command to start the log recording is simply `log using filename`, where `filename` is the name you want the log to have when saved. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** Carefully choose a file name that clearly indicates the analysis you are undertaking, with no spaces or capital letters.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Given that your work is likely to be submitted online, you should also get into the practice of saving your log-file as a text file that your instructor can view on Canvas. To create a log-file as a text file, we use the option `text`. You will probably be overwriting the same log-file many times (i.e. each time you run the do-file) so you should also use the option `replace`. \n",

    "\n",
    "It is imperative that you close your log-file at the end of your do-file. Otherwise, the log-file will continue to record all your work and cause your do-file to crash the next time you run that file. The command to close the log-file belongs at the very end of the do-file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The command to close the log-file is simply `log close`. The most common approach is to run the following command at both the beginning and end of your do-file. \n",

    "   capture log close\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we will discuss the `capture` command in [Module ](), what you should know at this point is that if you run this command and there is no log-file open, just ignore this line and keep going. This way you can avoid one of the most frustrating features of using do-files: if your do-file crashes partway through a run, the log-file will not be closed. Having the log-file still open will then cause the do-file to crash a second time when the do-file is next run."
