    "Imagine that we have constructed a dependent variable which contains the earnings growth of individual workers and we see that some worker's earnings increased by more than 400%. We might wonder if this massive change is just a coding error made by the statisticians that produced the data set. Even without that type of error, though, we might worry that the earnings growth of a small number of observations are driving the results of our analysis. If this is the case, we will produce an inaccurate analysis based on results that are not associated with the majority of our observations. \n",

    "The standard practice in these cases is to either winsorize or trim the subset of observations that are used in that regression.

What we are asking here is whether earnings is increasing with age at a decreasing rate. In essence, we want to check whether there is a concave relation between age and earnings. We can think of several mechanisms for why this relationship might exist: for a young worker, as they age they get higher wages through increased experience in the job; for an older worker, as they age those wage increases will be smaller as there are smaller productity gains with each additional year working. In fact, if the productivity of workers decreaseas as they age, perhaps for reasons related to health, then it is possible to find a negative relationship between age and earning beyond a certain age; the relationship is an inverted U-shape.\n",

Nonetheless, checking and correcting for outliers, as well as addressing heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity and non-linearity can be more of an art than a science. If you need any guidance on whether or not you need to address these issues, please be certain to speak with your instructor or TA."
