Examples of variables that are sometimes included as dummy variables are education, income and age. \n",

Make sure that missing values are coded as \".\" and not some value (such as \"99\"). Also, check that qualitative ranked variables are coded in the way you expect (e.g. higher education is coded with a larger number). If you do not do this, you could misinterpret your results.\n",

The coefficient on interaction terms, conversely, emphasizes how the relationship between a dependent and independent variable differs between groups, or differs as another variable changes.

    "The data that is provided to us is often not statistically representative of the  population as a whole. This is because the agencies that collect data (like Statistics Canada) often decide to over-sample some segments of the population. They do this to ensure that there is a large enough sample size of subgroups of the population to conduct meaningful statistical analysis of those sub-populations. For example, the population of Indigenous identity in Canada accounts for approximately 5% of the total population. If we took a representative sample of 10,000 Canadians, there would only be 500 people who identified as Indigenous in the sample. \n",

    "This creates two problems. The first is that this is is not a large enough sample to undertake any meaningful analysis of characteristics of the Indigenous population in Canada. The second is that when the sample is this this small, it might be possible for researchers to identify individuals in data. This would be extremely unethical, and Stats Canada works hard to make sure that data remains anonymized. \n",

    "To resolve this issue, Statistics Canada over-samples people of Indigenous identity when they collect data. For example, they might survey 1000 people of Indigenous identity so that those people now account for 10% of observations in the sample. This would allow researchers who want to specifically look at the experiences of Indigenous people to conduct reliable research, and maintain the anonymity of the individuals represented by the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use this whole sample of 10,000, however, the data is no longer nationally representative since it overstates the share of the population of Indigenous identity - 10% instead of 5%.

While `summarize` is used in Stata to calculate means, Stata has an incredibly useful command called `collapse` which creates a new set of summary statistics with sample weights factored into the calculations."

Another thing we can do with OLS is discuss causality: how does manipulating one variable impact a dependent variable on average?\n",

    "$\\mathbf{E}[X_i u_i] = 0$, the unobservables are uncorrelated with the independent variables of the equation (remember, this is not testable because we cannot compute the expectations in practice!). If these unobservables are correlated with an independent variable, this means the independent variable can be causing a change in the dependent variable because of a change in an unobservable rather than a change in the independent variable itself. This inhibits our ability to interpret our coefficients with causality and is known as the endogeneity problem. \n",

This brings us to a short discussion of what distinguishes good and bad controls in a regression model:\n",
