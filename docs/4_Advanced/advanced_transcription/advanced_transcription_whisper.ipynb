        "\n",
        "Audio transcription is the language processing task of converting audio\n",
        "files containing human speech into text using a computer. This task most\n",
        "often includes the process of *diarization*, the process of\n",
        "distinguishing and labeling the various speakers in the audio file.\n",
        "Application of audio transcription include multi-lingual captions on\n",
        "online videos, real-time online meeting transcription, and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems* are interfaces that use\n",
        "machine learning/artificial intelligence to process speech audio files\n",
        "into text. In this module, we will be using the open-source ASR system\n",
        "*Whisper* by OpenAI to transcribe and diarize various audio files.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 What is *Whisper*?\n",
        "\n",
        "Whisper is a ASR model for transcription and speech recognition designed\n",
        "by OpenAI. Whisper stands out from it’s predecessors due to it being\n",
        "trained on roughly 680 thousand hours of labeled audio transcription\n",
        "data, signfificantly more than the models that came before it; thus,\n",
        "Whisper exhibits a much higher accuracy when tested against audio data\n",
        "outside of it’s training set compared to older models such as\n",
        "*Wav2Vec*$^{[1]}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1.2.1 How does Whisper work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Whisper, and audio transcription models in general, work by converting\n",
        "raw audio data into a spectrogram, specifically a *Log-Mel spectrogam*,\n",
        "which plots the time on the x-axis, the mels scale (a logarithmic form\n",
        "of the Hertz frequency) on the y-axis, and colors the data with respect\n",
        "to the amplitude of the audio data at each mel frequency and point in\n",
        "time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mel-spectogram is then ran though a tokenizer, which converts the\n",
        "individual words in the spectrogram into lexical tokens- strings with\n",
        "assigned meaning that can be read by the language model. The encoder is\n",
        "a stack of transformer blocks that process the tokens, extracting\n",
        "features and relationships between different parts of the audio. The\n",
        "processed information from the encoder is passed to the decoder, another\n",
        "stack of transformer blocks that generate an output sequence (predicting\n",
        "the corresponding text captions word by word)$^{[2]}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"images/transformers.png\" alt=\"transformer process\" width = \"800\"/>\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1.2.2 Optimizing Whisper transcription\n",
        "\n",
        "Alongside whisper, there exist many libraries that aim to optimize the\n",
        "current whisper model by increasing transcription speed and accuracy.\n",
        "Some examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "**[Distil-Whisper](https://github.com/huggingface/distil-whisper)**: a\n",

        "50% smaller, and within a 1% word error rate relative to the original\n",
