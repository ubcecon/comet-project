        "There are methods of clustering other than the $k$-means clustering\n",
        "technique, such as the hierarchical clustering technique mentioned\n",
        "earlier. However, the $k$-means approach is the most intuitive and by\n",
        "far most common technique used in machine learning to classify\n",

        "Importantly, you may be wondering what the end of goal of clustering\n",
        "actually is. We used the $k$-means algorithm to group our 100\n",
        "observations into 2 clusters above, but how do we know whether this is a\n",
        "good classification? Are our results worthy of being presented, or is\n",
        "there a better way to cluster these points? Perhaps we can tweak our\n",
        "approach to get clusters which are compact, that is, clusters which\n",
        "don’t have wide variation from their mean cluster point. This is where\n",
        "that seemingly arbitrary choice of $K$ from earlier comes in.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Choosing $K$\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the most important decision when doing k-means clustering is the\n",
        "selection of $K$, the number of clusters. Choice of this value, while it\n",
        "may seem arbitrary, is actually critical in ensuring that our clustering\n",
        "is accurate. The goal when choosing a value for $K$ is to minimize the\n",
        "sum of within-cluster variation across all clusters. This means creating\n",
        "$K$ clusters so that the individual points within each cluster are as\n",
        "close to the center point of that cluster as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "An extremely bad value for $K$ is 1. With one cluster, there is actually\n",
        "no clustering occurring at all, so the total variance of all data points\n",
        "from their mean value is as large as possible. Increasing the value of\n",
        "$K$ allows for an increasing number of clusters, so that all available\n",
        "data points are crowded into increasingly small groups with consistently\n",
        "shrinking variances. From this, it may seem that the ideal value for $K$\n",
        "is $\\infty$, infinite clusters!\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this introduces the problem of **overfitting**. If we have an\n",
        "extremely large number of clusters, this means that our $k$-means\n",
        "algorithm is working incredibly hard to adapt to the specific set of\n",
        "points we have. Unfortunately, this means that it will perform\n",
        "substantially worse when new data is added. To put it simply, the\n",
        "machine has adapted so well to the specific data points we have that it\n",
        "cannot flexibly adjust for new data! As a result, the ideal choice of K\n",
        "lies somewhere on $(1, \\infty)$. The question is, how do we find it?\n",
        "\n",
        "One very common approach for finding an optimal value for $K$ is to\n",
        "graph what is called an **Elbow Plot**. An Elbow Plot represents the\n",
        "relationship between the value of $K$ and the total within-cluster\n",
        "variance. This graph naturally decreases; as $K$ increases, the number\n",
        "of clusters is increasing and so the within-cluster variance is\n",
        "decreasing. However, it begins to generate diminishing marginal returns\n",
        "for a certain $K$, meaning that the benefits from a larger number of\n",
