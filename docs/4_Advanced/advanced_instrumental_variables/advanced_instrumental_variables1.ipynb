        "medical costs of at-risk and some low-income Americans. In 2010, the\n",

        "\n",
        "The key question the states faced was: **should we extend health\n",
        "insurance to all low-income adults?**\n",
        "\n",

        "than the average American. This would result in a misleading estimate.\n",
        "We need another approach.\n",

        "From 2008 to 2011, the state of Oregon randomly assigned Medicaid\n",

        "(OHP) Standard Medicaid, once they submitted some documentation. The\n",

        "turned out to be ineligible to the program. In the end, only about 25%\n",
        "of the lottery winners eventually enrolled in OHP Standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the *possibility to apply for insurance* was randomly assigned by\n",
        "the lottery system, *insurance status* was not randomly assigned. This\n",
        "means that if health outcomes were related to the reason why they didn’t\n",
        "fill out their forms, or were ineligible, we could still have OVB.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately, there are ways around this “partial random assignment”. We\n",
